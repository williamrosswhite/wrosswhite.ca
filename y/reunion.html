<h5 class=MsoNormal>By W. Ross White </h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class=MsoNormal>Chapter 1</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>The year was 516.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, actually there was some debate about that.&nbsp; Some
people still chose to use the original Earth calendar would make the year 2839,
but they were rather in the minority, and they became irritated if the similar
arbitrariness of that calendar’s original day zero was pointed out to
them.&nbsp; Kathryn Barnes herself felt that of all the possible arbitrary
starting dates for their calendar, the day which their ancestors first arrived
on the planet Haven seemed most appropriate if one had to be picked.&nbsp; It
was after all a rather hard and undeniable boundary plane in their history.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As big as that day must have been for them so long ago
though, today was the biggest day in history which Kathryn herself would ever
be lucky enough to witness (or so she thought), and she was sufficiently
blessed to have a critical and central role in it.&nbsp; She was to be the
first person ever to be launched into space after her civilization had lost the
ability to do so less than a century after their arrival on the planet Haven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The generational ship which her ancestors had arrived in was
still in orbit, but it had been abandoned there since they had lost the ability
to return to it.&nbsp; It was kept operational in a support role to those on
the surface for as long as was possible, but it came time to abandon it the
very last of its fuel was used to boost it up to a high enough orbit that it
would be preserved there for eons.&nbsp; It served as an ever present reminder
to the people of Haven that they had come to this planet from another, and that
it was their inalienable destiny to return to the stars once again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was her destiny to return there today; she was the
first.&nbsp; Test missions had demonstrated the capacity of their new rocketry
to get her there, and another person had already conducted low orbit tests, but
it was her and her alone who would be remembered by her people forever as the
first person to step foot on the New Horizon again after it had been abandoned
so long ago.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Docking with it had been tricky.&nbsp; Although it was in a
stable orbit, over the centuries it had worked up a multi axis spin which she
had to account for.&nbsp; It had been a tense moment, but she had successfully
latched her capsule to the moving docking hatch.&nbsp; Once secured, her vessel
lazily spun along with the much larger craft it was connected to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She held her breath, and then pushed herself across the
threshold.&nbsp; Her capsule was trying to transfer sufficient power to allow
the space ship to reinitialize basic things like emergency lighting, but it
hadn’t worked yet.&nbsp; So far, the powerful lights on either side of her
helmet and ambient light from the interior of her own spacecraft were all that
provided any illumination.&nbsp; If the ship were operational, there would be
simulated gravity up on the rotating habitat ring, but down in the engineering
section where the docking ports were located, no such simulated gravity had
ever been designed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Holding onto a railing, she breathed again.&nbsp; She
absorbed the gravity of her situation, of holding a piece of the legendary ship
in her hands, and of having such a tactile connection with her ancestors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Commander
Barnes?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m
good, everything is good up here, I’m just… overwhelmed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s
understandable, but we’re reporting to you that we’ve just had an unscheduled
black out and we’re considering cutting your mission short.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>A
black out…” Kathryn echoed back in curiosity.&nbsp; She certainly hadn’t seen
that coming.&nbsp; Like clockwork, blackouts had occurred every one year, six
days, eight hours, three minutes and forty-two seconds for almost a hundred
years now.&nbsp; One occurring out of that schedule was…&nbsp; well, as mysterious
as them happening at all.&nbsp; It was an unexplained phenomenon which had
begun hundreds of years after they arrived on Haven and which no accepted
scientific theory could explain.&nbsp; Every one years, six days, eight hours,
three minutes and forty-two seconds, their sun darkened for exactly seven point
three eight seconds.&nbsp; It didn’t happen completely, but it was enough that
it made one able to continuously look at their sun with the naked eye during
that time without permanent damage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The last blackout was only a little under a month ago
though, and why one should occur outside of such a regular schedule was as
mysterious as the regular schedule itself or the phenomenon overall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
really think that’s necessary?” Kathryn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>There
are too many unknowns Barnes; we are dealing with an unknown disruption in the
schedule of an unknown spatial phenomenon.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m
here.&nbsp; I prefer to stay.&nbsp; I’ll return if you order me to of course or
if something else comes of the phenomenon, but I don’t see any connection. &nbsp;We
know there’s no radiological risks of a blackout; in fact it only reduces the
solar radiation while it<span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>’</span>s
occurring.&nbsp; I think my carrying on is an acceptable risk.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She waited anxiously while the team back at mission control
reviewed their options.&nbsp; She’d been training for this and excited about it
for a long time.&nbsp; It would be such a profound disappointment to have to
turn back now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Barnes
we’re going to let you proceed but only provisionally.&nbsp; If anything else
happens, even if its meaning is ambiguous we’re going to recall you, but
barring that we’re going to allow you to proceed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Thank
you,” she said with a smile, and continued to pull herself down the engineering
central access corridor.&nbsp; It was her first time in authentic micro
gravity, and she was enjoying the sensation of floating as she gently pushed
herself off of one railing after another.&nbsp; She reached the central hub
where the long cylinder of the engineering section met the spokes which
suspended the habitat ring about it, and which was designed to rotate around to
simulate gravity in the living areas of the ship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She shone her helmet light down each of the four spokes one
at a time, but all four looked identical. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m at
the central hub…” she reported as she observed the markings which labeled which
tube was which.&nbsp; “Proceeding down tube three towards the bridge as
planned.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Understood.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As she started to push herself down the access tube, her
radio broke in again.&nbsp; “Barnes get out now.”&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Understood.”&nbsp;
It was a direct and unambiguous order; she had to act on it without question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On her way back to her capsule, her team filled her
in.&nbsp; “We had another unscheduled black out, twelve minutes after the
previous one.&nbsp; We still don’t know what it means, but there’s definitely
something going on and we just can’t have you up there and exposed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
understand.”&nbsp; She was disappointed, but she did understand.&nbsp; They
would have been perfectly within their rights to have recalled her after the
first unexpected blackout.&nbsp; She was lucky to have gotten as far as she
did.&nbsp; She was lucky to be there at all.&nbsp; Whatever came next, she was
first onboard again, and her people’s history would remember her as long as
they remembered anybody.&nbsp; Still, she’d really hoped to have seen so much
more.&nbsp; Maybe they’d let her come back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before she floated back into her capsule, she noticed that
the display panel just beyond the airlock was activated, and displayed on it
was an incoming communication request.&nbsp; She didn’t know what to make of
it.&nbsp; Her own people certainly wouldn’t contact her this way, and the power
transfer to the ship from her capsule was never intended to power up the ship’s
onboard comm system.&nbsp; Who else could it be?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And yet, there it was, an unexpected and impossible incoming
comm request, just as mysterious as the blackouts and the interruption of their
otherwise clockwork schedule.&nbsp; Could there be a connection? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Tynes,
I’m outside of the airlock to my capsule, and I’m… I’m seeing an incomming comm
request on the airlock panel.&nbsp; It’s weird… that system shouldn’t have any
power, there’s nobody who should be making such a call, and yet… there it
is.&nbsp; I want to answer it and see what happens.”&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Please
hold,” her liaison at Tynes Spaceflight Centre requested while the occurrence
she’d reported was discussed.&nbsp; It certainly wouldn’t be difficult to
accept the call, although the New Horizons systems were optimized for thought
control via devices which used to be known as Brainchips installed in every
adolescent.&nbsp; Her own people were still many years away from recreating
that level of neurocybernetics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Barnes
we’re going to allow you to proceed.&nbsp; We are all watching your helmet’s
video feed very carefully down here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nodding, she reached out to touch the answer button on the
panel where it indicated, but just before her finger reached the panel, the
comm request ended.&nbsp; With a furrowed brow she lowered her thickly gloved
hand to her side with some confusion.&nbsp; She then nearly leapt out of her
space suit when the comm request lit up again.&nbsp; After composing herself,
taking a moment to laugh at herself a little as she did so, she reached out to
touch the screen again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A strikingly attractive male face appeared on the screen.&nbsp;
His strong jaw was clean shaven and he appeared to be a man in his late
forties.&nbsp; His brown hair was neither particularly long or short, but was
neatly cut, and he was wearing a crisp button up white shirt.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Greetings,”
the man offered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Greetings,”
she tentatively offered in return without any idea what else to say.&nbsp; She
was speechless not only at the look of him, but his mysterious presence on the
comm panel at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>My
name is Jaren.&nbsp; I’ve come from the Eta Cassiopeiae system. “</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Eta
Cassioeiae,” she muttered in repetition as she looked down through her face
plate fishbowl for the significance of those words.&nbsp; The fact that there
were other humans out there was not any kind of shock or unknown to
Kathryn.&nbsp; It was well understood that her people had come from the planet
humans had originally evolved on, and they’d always known there had been other
colony missions before and probably even after their own.&nbsp; The thing was,
since before her people had even landed on Haven, they’d lost contact with Earth
and had never been able to establish contact with any other colonies around
other stars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Where
are you?” Kathryn finally asked.&nbsp; She’d managed to compose herself and
refocus on the job.&nbsp; “Where are you transmitting from?&nbsp; How did you
power and access the New Horizon?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I er,
we are in your star system,” Jaren answered.&nbsp; “My small crew and I are on
our way to your planet to say hello.&nbsp; We’ve visited your system before,
but we’ve never made contact before.&nbsp; We didn’t want to disturb your…
development, but you’ve reached the point at which we decided to wait until
before formally making contact.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>And
what point was that?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>When
you were able to reach the New Horizon again.&nbsp; We left monitoring
equipment here which let us know when you’d managed to accomplish this.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Ask
him how he learned of this if he had to wait for a signal to be sent back to
his own star system.” Tynes Control demanded in hers ear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How
were you able to find out so fast?”&nbsp; She was instinctively suspicious of
him.&nbsp; Maybe it was her training.&nbsp; Maybe it was her instincts as a
woman to second guess someone she was attracted to.&nbsp; For whatever reason
her eyes were perpetually somewhat narrowed in her scrutiny of him.&nbsp;
“Wait, for that matter how did you get here so fast after finding out?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
have a technology which allows us to open up portals between stars.&nbsp; We
call it the Escher Rift.&nbsp; By harnessing the power output of an entire star
for several seconds, and then redirecting it to a particular point in space,
we’re able to open an Escher which allows us to instantaneously communicate or
send a ship through.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
blackouts…” she suddenly understood, and could hear some commotion back on Haven
as other people down at Tynes had the same realization.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
whatnow?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We… we
call them blackouts; our sun dims for seven point three eight seconds every one
year, six days, eight hours, three minutes and forty-two seconds.&nbsp; That’s
been your doing all along?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Mmm,
afraid so, yes.&nbsp; We’re very sorry if that disturbed or concerned you, but
the specific time is just the precise length of a year on our planet.&nbsp; We
programmed our monitoring devices to rift home a yearly update on your status.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>And
the two unexpected ones today were your drone reporting new activity and then
you coming through in a ship.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Correct.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
that certainly that explains a lot.”&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren just smiled broadly and Kathryn had to look away or
start smiling like an idiot herself in response.&nbsp; “I need to consult with
my people,” she told him as she pretended to be looking down at a
communications device which didn’t exist.&nbsp; “Please send another comm
request like you did before in two minutes alright?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Absolutely.”&nbsp;
The panel screen returned to its inactive standby status.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
Tynes, what do you think?” she asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It
certainly explains the blackouts,” a different voice affirmed in her
helmet.&nbsp; It was the voice of the Flight Director Krantz himself.&nbsp;
“Finally,” he added with a deliberate note of irritation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Barnes
we need to know what they’re here for, what they want,” he instructed
her.&nbsp; “We also need to know if they know anything about what happened to
Earth, and how many other colonies are out there.&nbsp; There’s so much to
ask…&nbsp; We need to find out how their Escher technology works and how we can
develop it for ourselves.&nbsp; If they can do that there has to be other
technologies they’ve developed that we could get our hands on, not to mention
their military capabilities and intentions.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Okay,
okay, I get it.”&nbsp; She was frustrated with his seemingly aimless
musing.&nbsp; As the panel lit up again with another comm request she said to
Krantz: “let’s just start with asking what they want from us…” She touched the
panel again to system open the channel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Why
are you here?” she asked with deliberate assertiveness.&nbsp; She was trying to
balance diplomacy with the subtlest of undertones of confident
aggression.&nbsp; It was the same tone she put on when she had to be harsh with
male underlings she thought didn’t adequately respect a female superior.&nbsp;
“What exactly do you want from us?&nbsp; Why exactly did it matter to you when
we reached this ship again?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He seemed a little taken aback at her assertiveness and she
was pleased, she’d wanted to put him back on his heels just a bit.&nbsp;
Attractive as he was, she’d grown increasingly uncomfortable with the power
imbalance of him having all the answers and her only questions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren leaned back in his chair, put his elbows up on his
armrests and laced his fingers.&nbsp; He let out a sigh.&nbsp; “We want many
things er, I’m sorry what did you say your name was?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
didn’t,” she informed him with a quickly darted up right eyebrow and flash of a
smug smile.&nbsp; Power balance restored, she happily thought to herself.&nbsp;
“But it’s Barnes.&nbsp; Commander Barnes of the Haven United Forces.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Commander,”
he acknowledged her with a nod.&nbsp; “We seek friendship, open contact, and
collaboration with your world.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Un
hunh,” she grunted dismissively.&nbsp; “And that’s all?” She asked.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No,”
he admitted with pursed lips.&nbsp; “We also want access to the New Horizon’s
archives.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Thank
you for being honest.&nbsp; Tell me why.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>My
people… well, we quite regrettably and short sightedly declined to take most of
Earth’s history or cultural heritage with us on our generational starship when
we originally set out.&nbsp; We… they, didn’t think it was important, but…
well, they were wrong.”&nbsp; She found herself a little touched at how
sincerely sad he seemed to be at this profound error of his forebears.&nbsp;
“We have made contact with one other colony since we’ve developed the rift
technology, but unfortunately they made a similar error when they left.&nbsp;
We tried looking for answers back on Earth itself, but…” he shook his head and
looked away in apparent sadness, or at least further disappointment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Wait,
you’ve been back to Earth?&nbsp; What did you find??”&nbsp; What had happened to
Earth, why it had gone dark halfway through their journey to Haven was the
greatest mystery of all on her planet, the impetus of immeasurable amount of
speculation, fear, and storytelling ever since.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well…
we found humans for sure, but certainly not much in the way of
civilization.&nbsp; There had been no efforts made to preserve Earth history
long term and without an active civilization around to curate information, all
records disappeared as all digital storage media inevitably became corrupted.&nbsp;
As such… there is only known to us one remaining repository of all of the
history, art, and culture of Earth as it was in the entire universe”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>New
Horizon’s physical archives…” she marvelled.&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; For her own
people it was a primary prize on the ship but she could see how it could be
even more so for Jaren’s people if they’d brought none of it along.&nbsp; All
digital storage media on the surface had degraded beyond repair long before
they’d learned how to recreate anything comparable, but they’d had it at one point,
and a significant amount of it had been preserved through copied out physical
texts or oral history and other forms of preservation.&nbsp; She could see
though how empty a fog the past would seem without any of the information there
to be preserved at all in the first place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Exactly.&nbsp;
The New Horizon’s physical archives.&nbsp; Your founders were very wise.&nbsp;
They had the foresight not only to take with them all of the wisdom and
knowledge of Earth, but to preserve it in so robust a way that it could survive
unpowered and in a vacuum effectively for eternity.&nbsp; To us… those archives
have taken on something of a mystical quality; like the… wisdom and knowledge
of the ancients.”&nbsp; His demeanor seemed to reveal his genuine
reverence.&nbsp; She could almost swear she could detect the slightest
mistiness in his eyes as he spoke of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
could have just taken it from us at any time though could you not?&nbsp; Or
even probably copy it and leave again without us ever knowing.&nbsp; Why didn’t
you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Because
it’s yours,” he said with a shrug.&nbsp; “That’s… just not our way.&nbsp; It
would be disrespectful somehow of those who created it, not to mention your
people, the legitimate heirs of it.&nbsp; It belongs to you; it’s your legacy,
your endowment as a people, not ours.&nbsp; Now that you are ready though, now
that you have taken this great technological leap, we are here to offer you a
trade.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Go
on…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
want to make a copy of the entire archives, and in exchange for your permission
to do so, we are prepared to offer you access to our Escher Rift system.&nbsp;
You can use it to visit us, the Delta Pavonis colony, Earth… or any of the
uninhabited systems our drones have been able to set up the local
infrastructure, or will in the future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s…
quite an offer,” Kathryn conceded while trying to keep her considerable
excitement in check.&nbsp; As a person oriented towards excitement, adventure,
and discovery, this was all quite literally a dream coming true.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
certainly hoped it would be enticing,” Jaren said with a warm but knowing
smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn looked down and to her right while listening to
distant voices debate how they should proceed.&nbsp; Finally a single voice
clearly broke through the din.&nbsp; It was Krantz.&nbsp; “Tell him we accept
in principle, and ask him how he suggests we proceed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We are
willing to accept your offer in,” she reiterated.&nbsp; “Given that, how do you
suggest that we proceed?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren smiled even wider at the good news.&nbsp; “Well,” he
answered, “it would be too onerous for us to bring all of the equipment we
would need all the way here.&nbsp; We would like to refurbish the New Horizon
for you as a gesture of our good will.&nbsp; We would fuel and restart all of
the power systems, update and restart the fusion core, magnetic shield, ion
engines… we’d get the habitat ring spinning again to get you some gravity, and
even rebuild the arboretum and the rest of your life support system, the
works.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This was beyond her imagining.&nbsp; Hew own people had
technologically slid backwards quite considerably after their arrival on Haven,
and were only now rediscovering basic rocketry.&nbsp; They’d hoped to learn
much from studying the engineering of New Horizon and pouring through its
archives, but the idea of refurbishing the ship and setting sail in it again
was dreamt of only by the maddest among them.&nbsp; It was more an artefact to
them than a vessel, a dead tomb as opposed to a sleeping marvel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
could help us and learn along the way,” he added, “and when we’re all done you
can re-commission the ship and use it however you wish.&nbsp; It would be your
gateway to the rift system until you develop another vehicle, and you could
explore your own system and others through the rift system.&nbsp; But first,
while you enjoy all the lavish trappings of an official diplomatic visit with
us, we would get to work very carefully and methodically copying all of the
information stored in the archives.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Where
are you in our system at this point?” Kathryn asked him as casually as
possible, still trying to keep her nearly bursting excitement contained until
the end of the conversation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We are
still quite near to your star.&nbsp; Eschers can only be initiated very near to
one.&nbsp; We have rather effective engines, but it will still take us
approximately six of your days to arrive at your planet.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
call it Haven,” Kathryn remarked with a larger note of pride than she’d
expected from herself at relaying her home’s name to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Of
course,” he conceded with a deferential smile, “and tell your people not to
worry.&nbsp; We are a small ship on a diplomatic mission, and there are only
four of us.&nbsp; Though advanced, our vessel has limited armaments and one of
your nuclear tipped missile could easily destroy us.&nbsp; We are not a threat
to any of your people.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
understand, and I will relay your message.&nbsp; How do we proceed?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>As I
said, it will take us six days to reach you.&nbsp; Our ship has the capacity to
freely land and return to orbit, so we can meet you on the surface if your
people don’t have the capacity or desire to send anyone up to us.&nbsp; In the
meantime, as soon as a hard agreement has been reached, I can send a message
back through another Escher to that effect, and have teams coming through to
work on the New Horizon very soon after.&nbsp; When it’s ready, your people can
assemble a team to board the ship and be escorted through the Escher to our
star system.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Thank
you Jaren, I will relay all of this to my authorities.&nbsp; We will be in
touch.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It was
very nice to meet you Commander Barnes,” he said with a smile in which she
detected something more than mere friendliness, and which made her feel warm
though she did her best to not let it show.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You as
well, Jaren.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She touched the panel to close the channel, and brought her
gloved hands up to grab onto the bulkhead in front of her as she lowered her
head and let out a long sigh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Control?”
she asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes
Commander?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
don’t have nuclear tipped missiles do we?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s
classified.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn kept her eyes closed as she shook her head.&nbsp;
‘Idiots…’&#8195;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class=MsoNormal>Chapter 2</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathryn
stood alone in the Presidential residence’s conference room, fidgeting.&nbsp;
It was one of her few bad habits that she was prone to picking at her nails
when she was bored or nervous, but particularly when she was nervous.&nbsp;
She’d met the president before, but only in passing; she’d never had a formal
meeting with her before.&nbsp; The room had tall floor to ceiling windows, and
it allowed a spectacular view out over the capital city.&nbsp; It only seemed
appropriate to her that decisions made which affected their whole society
should take place here, with all of those affected by those decisions in plain
sight.&nbsp; Still wearing the one piece flight suit she’d worn under her space
suit earlier that day, she looked out over the city with her hands clasped
behind her back, and with new eyes as she reviewed in her mind the day’s
events.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
the totality, Kathryn was overall quite proud of what her people had
accomplished, but she had to admit to herself that some of that pride was
wrapped up in the possibility of her people being the only humans left in the
galaxy.&nbsp; This was never presumed to certainly be the case, but it had
always been widely understood as a distinct possibility.&nbsp; This possibility
had always lent a certain gravity to everything they’d ever done on this
planet, on everything they had ever accomplished.&nbsp; Now she was slightly
concerned at her sense that there was now an ever so slight tarnish on their accomplishments,
a certain loss of… significance, however minute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
city she looked out on was an order of magnitude larger than any other on the
planet.&nbsp; It had originally been founded as two different
settlements.&nbsp; When they’d first arrived on the planet conflict had
immediately broken out between two factions, but a lasting peace had been
negotiated in each faction having their own settlement.&nbsp; Those who cared
about the peace lasting had wisely negotiated that the two encampments be close
enough to facilitate trade and close contact and collaboration.&nbsp; It wasn’t
too long before the original divides were lost in time to their ancestors, and
the two growing communities merged completely into one beautiful city now
referred to as Twin Cities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathryn’s
people had come far.&nbsp; Although their mission to this planet had originally
been designed to allow them to maintain and eventually build upon the level of
technology Earth had at the time they left, the time they left, the factional
conflict when they’d arrived had set them back considerably.&nbsp; Besides the
mere destruction of sophisotcated equipment they couldn’t simply repair or
reproduce, there had been a significant loss of life, nearly half of the entire
crew (*?) according to records.&nbsp; This set them back far more than the mere
loss of materiel.&nbsp; They had arrived with what was considered the bare
minimum number of personnel to maintain the level of technological and societal
complexity they had launched with.&nbsp; Although they had a lot of information
to work from, knowledge is a living thing which reproduces by education, and
know-how is something altogether different from knowledge.&nbsp; Attrition of
knowledge and know-how as things broke down and knowledge became corrupted fell
them to a nearly pre-enlightenment level of technology before they bent the
curve and begin progressing again.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, five hundred years later, they had rediscovered
rocketry, circuitry computing, nuclear power… things which were very exciting
for her predecessors, but by her nature Kathryn was always looking
forward.&nbsp; She’d read all kinds of stories about what her people had once
been capable of, and had long been captivated by the several museums which
carefully housed and preserved the technological artifacts of the early
days.&nbsp; After only a few years of operation, one of the New Horizon’s two
original shuttles had blown up on re-entry, but the second one lasted much
longer, and had been respectfully retired to the Haven Air and Space Museum
when the New Horizon itself had been likewise retired by boosting it up to high
orbit.&nbsp; They’d used the shuttle to do so, and that was the last time
they’d been to space until today.&nbsp; That was over three hundred and fifty
years ago now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathryn
was aware of what technological wonders lay ahead of them, which was why she’d
worked so hard since her early childhood towards the dream of seeing the New
Horizon in person.&nbsp; They’d been close for some time now, but only now were
they confident enough to put a human on top of the barely controlled explosion
that was a rocket.&nbsp; The risk was worth it though, especially for her
personally.&nbsp; Like it was for many of her people, the New Horizon was the
embodiment of everything they’d lost, and the promise of everything they were
destined to reclaim.&nbsp; It was the repository of the ancients, home of the
Gods; it was Mount Olympus itself and she’d been very lucky to be the first to
return there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But
today had not gone the way anybody had planned, and by a lot.&nbsp; This
debriefing with the president had always been part of the full plan of her
first launch, but it had of course taken on an entirely different meaning
now.&nbsp; It had originally been planned as a celebration of her
accomplishment, the typical congratulatory and politically opportune photo op
meeting with the president after a great accomplishment for her society.&nbsp;
Now though, it was a meeting to discuss what had happened during her
mission.&nbsp; The president needed to know everything Kathryn could tell her
about their visitors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Commander
Barnes?” asked the well-dressed man who had originally shown her into the
conference room.&nbsp; She didn’t know his name, but it was clear that it was
the president’s aide.&nbsp; “The president will see you now.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Thank
you.”&nbsp; Kathryn allowed herself to be led through the tall heavy wood
double doorway out of the conference room and into the president’s office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Ah,
Barnes!” the president exclaimed.&nbsp; “Yes, come in, come in…”&nbsp; The
middle aged woman with vaguely Asian facial features got up from behind her
desk to greet her with a handshake, going so far as to clasp her second hand
over the shake.&nbsp; “You’ve had quite a day haven’t you?” she asked with
seemingly genuine sincerity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Yes
ma’am,” Kathryn admitted with a smile.&nbsp; “As I’m sure you have as
well.”&nbsp; Although she’d never met the president more than in passing, she
liked her, and the more contact she had with her the more she liked her.&nbsp;
Though her position in the military (*?) required outwardly steadfast
political, privately she supported the president politically.&nbsp; Kathryn had
voted for her both times, and so far didn’t regret it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The president widened her eyes and nodded as if to say ‘you
have no idea.’&nbsp; “Indeed, she verbally answered, “I just got out of a
cabinet meeting about what happened.&nbsp; There were… a variety of views and
opinions about it and how to proceed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I can
imagine.” Kathryn offered non-committally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I have
to tell you, a lot of people in that room wanted you to be part of that
mission.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn nodded respectfully, adequately containing and
masking her excitement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
wanted to speak to you one on one though.&nbsp; Before we make any moves or
decisions, I want to know your impressions, of the situation, of this
Jaren…”&nbsp; The woman rounded the desk to sit at her chair as she gestured to
Kathryn to take a seat at the opposite side of the desk. &nbsp;“I want you to
feel free to speak openly and in confidence.&nbsp; What do you think of all
this Commander?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>To be
honest… I really don’t know what to make of it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Go
on.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It
just… it really all just seems far too good to be true.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,”
the president agreed with a newly serious tone, “my thoughts exactly.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I find
myself suspicious.&nbsp; Maybe it’s just my natural inclination though.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Why do
you say that?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn spared the president her personal hang up about
instinctively distrusting men she was attracted to.&nbsp; “The thing is, it all
seems logically consistent.&nbsp; Try as I might, I can’t see any error in the
reason of what he explained and proposed.&nbsp; Nothing he said was impossible”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
would have to agree,” President Kim offered.&nbsp; “I’ve been trying to poke
holes in his words ever since I heard them but I’ve met with no success.&nbsp;
Neither have any in my cabinet other than… well, other than the same
instinctive mistrust you expressed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn continued.&nbsp; “If they have the technology
required to be able to create the kind of rift portal they described, then
there’s no doubt that they could have just taken what they wanted without
saying anything at all to us.&nbsp; That’s… that’s what I keep coming back
around to Madame President, that they didn’t need to contact us at all, they
didn’t have to offer us anything at all or make any kind of friendly overtures
whatsoever.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You’re
quite right,” President Kim nodded in agreement.&nbsp; “What I keep coming back
around to though, is again that it just all seems far too good to be
true.&nbsp; Either we’ve just had an unbelievably fortuitous world changing
gift dropped into our laps clear out of the blue, or…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Or?”
Kathryn asked with a raised eyebrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Or… he
has an alternate agenda.”&nbsp; The president stared deeply into the pen she
repeatedly poked at her desk with as she considered the possibility.&nbsp;
“What if… the whole story about the archives is just a rouse?&nbsp; What if
there is something else they want which they are carefully avoiding mentioning
at all.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>This
is indeed a possibility Madame President, I readily concede that.&nbsp; However
I just can’t imagine what that might be.&nbsp; I mean… I cannot imagine what a
people so far advanced beyond us technologically could possibly want from us
other than information they can’t get or generate anywhere else by any other
means.&nbsp; With instantaneous access to multiple star systems they have
access effectively infinite natural resources, so they can’t want anything we
have in that area.&nbsp; Presumably they have a biotechnical sophistication
equivalent to their physics, so they should be able to manufacture for themselves
any biological materials they could find here.&nbsp; We know that we certainly
had that kind of technology when we left Earth, and we didn’t even have
anything like their rift technology.&nbsp; If what they say about the Earth is
true though…”&nbsp; Kathryn shook her head slowly as she thought</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes?”
the president urged her on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Then
culture truly is the only resource in the galaxy which they can’t get elsewhere
or manufacture for themselves.&nbsp; In that case, the New Horizon archive is
the only thing in the entire universe which can tell them what they want to
know about ancient Earth culture.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>But,”
the president reiterated, “again, why not just take it from us by force?&nbsp;
Hell, you and I both know they wouldn’t even need force, they could just take
it without us ever knowing until we made it up there ourselves to discover it
was missing.&nbsp; Why all the nicety?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn nibbled at the inside of her cheek as she considered
the question.&nbsp; It was a good one.&nbsp; Eventually she thought she’d come
across a possible answer.&nbsp; “Maybe because… we are a cultural resource for
them as well.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Go
on…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>If
they can extract or manufacture any physical or biological resource, then as I
said the only thing they can’t make for themselves is culture.&nbsp; Our
stories, our art, our… ways of seeing the world, our friendship and
collaboration, these are all things which they can’t have access to if they
aggress against us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Or
maybe they’re just a really sweet, kind, and considerate people.”&nbsp;
President Kim held her straight face for a moment before they both started
laughing at the thought. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When they’d released enough pent up nervous energy their
laughter subsided and the president got serious again.&nbsp; “So you’re in
than?&nbsp; You think that we should co-operate and see what happens?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well…
ma’am, my position is obviously quite different from yours.&nbsp; Of course I’m
in no matter what, but I’m only responsible for myself.&nbsp; If there was an
eighty percent chance of doom but a twenty percent chance of wondrous
discovery, my curiosity would compel me to move ahead.&nbsp; I don’t have the
responsibility of our whole civilization on my shoulders the way you do.&nbsp;
Yes I’m in, yes I think it’s worth the risk, but I can only speak for myself.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The president scrutinized her closely as she tapped the
point of her pen against her desk.&nbsp; “You ever thought about getting into
politics? she asked Kathryn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No
ma’am,” she answered with a nervous smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
you should think about it,” the president suggested as she leaned back in her
chair and slowly swivelled back and forth.&nbsp; “You might surprise yourself,
I suspect you’d be a natural.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Thank
you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Hmm.&nbsp;
Well thank you for your thoughts.&nbsp; Lionel will show you out.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn was slightly startled to find that the man who had
shown her in was already standing right beside her.&nbsp; The president didn’t
get up to say goodbye, instead turning around in her chair to look out over the
city through similar floor to ceiling windows as the conference room behind her
desk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Good
day Madame President,” Kathryn said as she stood and allowed herself to be led
out of the room by Lionel, but the president didn’t answer, instead continuing
to look out the window.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Barnes?”
the president asked when they were nearly at the door, still looking out the
window.&nbsp; Kathryn and Lionel turned around expectantly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Some
in my cabinet think that as our first in space you’re a national treasure too
valuable to put at risk again, that we should put you in a glass cage and put
you on display the rest of your life…&nbsp; However I’m one to think talent and
experience is a terrible thing to waste.&nbsp; I assume that if we decide to
proceed with this Jaren that you would be willing to form and lead the team
that would be working with him?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn’s heart leapt.&nbsp; She’d barely dared hope that
she would have the chance to be a member of the team, but she’d never imagined
that the president would ask her to lead the team.&nbsp; “Um, yes ma’am, of
course,” she stammered.&nbsp; “Thank you ma’am,” she added
enthusiastically.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The president seemed to nod as she continued to look out
over the city, and Linonel held his hand out to continue leading her out of the
room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#8195;</p>

<h4 class=MsoNormal>Chapter 3</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathryn
stepped out the front doors onto the street in front of the State House, and
was greeted by chilly air which made her wrap her coat more tightly around
herself.&nbsp; She didn’t like the cold.&nbsp; She didn’t particularly care for
the heat much more, but she handled heat better than she did the cold.&nbsp; It
seemed easier to ignore the heat than it was the cold, which seemed to always
immediately penetrate down to her bones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She was a little stunned as she stood on the street, barely
noticing the bustle and noise of the major throughfare.&nbsp; A wave of faint
came over her and she momentarily had to brace herself against a street sign
post.&nbsp; The reality of what had happened was finally fully falling on her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
reunion… they’d resumed contact.&nbsp; The existence of the other colonies had
by this point become almost… well, practically myth.&nbsp; They’d long ago lost
any real hope or expectation of ever coming into contact with human beings
elsewhere in the galaxy.&nbsp; Re-establishing contact seemed even more
unlikely than there being anyone out there to re-establish contact with.&nbsp;
Some fringe elements of their society had even begun to conceive of the
conspiracy theory that humans had evolved on Haven, and that the whole distant
origin theory was a myth.&nbsp; It was preposterous of course, but it betrayed
just how alone and isolated they felt.&nbsp; Given how hard it had been for
their own colony to survive let alone flourish, most assumed at this point that
they were the only surviving colony.&nbsp; Either way, even if there were other
humans out there… there’d never been any way to find out, and no real prospects
for developing any way to find out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
today happened.&nbsp; In one day, one moment really, their whole world flipped
on its axis.&nbsp; This morning they were alone in the universe, but now they
had a sibling civilization, in fact several by the sounds of it.&nbsp; Now it
seemed somehow everything had changed in one day.&nbsp; Alone at the top of the
mountain, down to somewhere further down the slope but at least now with
company.&nbsp; On top of all that it had been her personally who’d made that
contact.&nbsp; She’d earned the privilege of being the first person to return
to the New Horizon, sometimes that was hard for her to understand, hard for her
to square her relatively modest view of herself with the scale of the position
she now occupied in her people’s story with just that honour, and now to pile
on having made first contact with other humans, and then now to possibly be
charged with leading the expedition… it was overwhelming to say the least.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her
fianc&eacute; Tobyn pulled up to the curb in their car, and she opened the door and
climbed in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Hello
sweetheart,” he said as she latched her safety belt.&nbsp; “It’s so good to see
you home safely!&nbsp; You know I get so worried when you go up…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Yes
I know…” she replied listlessly, while trying to not appear too
dismissive.&nbsp; It bothered her how much her work distressed Tobyn.&nbsp; It
kept a divide between them.&nbsp; Her work was challenging enough without the
added burden of having to worry about him worrying about her.&nbsp; Nothing in
the universe mattered to her as much as her job, and it was the biggest issue
he had with her.&nbsp; She found herself wondering why they’d gotten engaged at
all given all that.&nbsp; She wasn’t looking forward to the epic fight that was
going to come when she told him about her new orders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They’d been quite in love once, but that seemed like a long
time ago now.&nbsp; In her heart she’d known for a while that they were heading
to some sort of ending, but it was hard for her to confront that reality, and
she was a the point of putting in whatever minimum of effort and attention was
required to keep things going to put off that end.&nbsp; And then he
proposed.&nbsp; What was he thinking?&nbsp; Was he really that blind?&nbsp; Or
was it a sort of hail mary for him, trying to reignite something he on some
level knew was dead or dying.&nbsp; She was never sure, and just tried not to
think about it most times.&nbsp; It was getting harder and harder to just
ignore things though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then there was the family thing… Although she’d never
written off the possibility completely, having children and all that had never
been much of a priority for Kathryn.&nbsp; Ever since she could remember, she’d
had one goal, the life and career she was in the middle of living out right
now, today specifically even.&nbsp; Children and all that always seemed like it
was just something which would get in the way of what was really
important.&nbsp; Still though, she’d never written it off entirely.&nbsp; Some
part of her, perhaps the parts of her that really cherished how important and
comforting her own family had been to her when she was a child, forbid her
saying never.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tobyn on the other hand, was as focused on starting a family
as a priority as she was on her career.&nbsp; He knew how she felt about it
though, so why did he stay?&nbsp; Was he holding out hope that her not
necessarily never would somehow evolve into an okay forget everything else and
let’s do it now?&nbsp; It was hard to be too harsh on him though, because she
was guilty too.&nbsp; In the past… when things were good, and they were newly
in love, it seemed like such an immaterial difference between them.&nbsp; Now
it felt like a heavy weight on her chest whenever she looked at him.&nbsp; What
the hell were they even doing at this point?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She looked out the window as she thought, watching the world
go by and not having to look at him.&nbsp; Nothing had changed, why was she
admitting all of this to herself now out of the blue?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Still,
it’s good to have you back…” he said, sounding unusually unsure of
himself.&nbsp; “And it’s so exciting what happened to you up there, the whole city
is buzzing about it!&nbsp; Nobody’s quite sure what it means or what’s going to
happen next!&nbsp; Tobyn stopped at an intersection for a red light, and they
could see a crowd gathered around an electronics store, watching President Kim
give a speech on the demo television sets.&nbsp; Noticing this, Tobyn switched
on the radio to the public broadcaster.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “…you
should all be as proud of Commander Barnes as I am.”&nbsp; The light turned
green and Tobyn started moving again.&nbsp; “Her professionalism and dedication
is why I have selected her to lead the expedition to the planet Eta Cassiopae,
at the invitation of our new friends…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathryn
switched off the radio and folded her arms with a sigh as she looked up at the
ceiling of the car.&nbsp; Tobyn pulled into the first available parking lot and
parked, then shut the car off.&nbsp; He and Kathryn both kept looking forward
in silence for too long.&nbsp; “Is that true?” Tobyn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
response Kathryn pulled the door handle and got out of the car.&nbsp; She was
still just wearing her flight suit with a winter coat overtop of it and it was
getting progressively colder out as the sun sank on the horizon.&nbsp; She
wrapped the coat around herself as tightly as she could as she looked out into
the multi coloured dusk on the horizon.&nbsp; They’d happened to have stopped
in an industrial area, and the silver canisters and tubing of the manufacturing
plant they’d pulled into the lot of was cast against a grey concrete vehicle
overpass behind it, all back dropped by the moody orange sky.&nbsp; Tobyn
likewise extricated himself from the vehicle, and then came around to leaned
against the car with his arms folded as he looked at her.&nbsp; “Well?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She didn’t answer at first, instead studying the horizon for
answers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’m
leaving you,” she finally concluded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What??”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Tobyn…
you must know that this has been a long time coming.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “But
Kathryn!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Stop,
please… just stop.&nbsp; I’ve made up my mind.”&nbsp; She took a deep breath
and turned around to face him, before coming over to join him leaning up
against the car beside him.&nbsp; “You’re a good man Tobyn.&nbsp; I… I don’t
want to hurt you anymore than necessary.&nbsp; It’s just… my job is hard enough
worrying about myself without… having to worry about you worrying about me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “You’re
serious, aren’t you?&nbsp; You’re certain…”&nbsp; He knew her well enough to
know that if she really had made up her mind then there was no arguing with
her, no reasoning with her or changing her mind again.&nbsp; He’d tried before,
but had only ever met with frustration and ultimate failure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I
am.” she said in more of a whisper than she’d intended.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Fine.”
Tobyn said through gritted teeth, increasingly angry.&nbsp; “How much time do
you need to clear your shit out?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Tobyn!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “How
long?” he asked with cold fire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Just
the… just the night” she said.&nbsp; She felt awful.&nbsp; She wished he’d look
at her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Fine.”&nbsp;
Tobyn went back around to the driver’s side of the car, got in, and slammed the
door closed.&nbsp; The engine roared to life and with a smoking squeal of tires
he was off, and she was alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’m
sorry… but I had a feeling you two wouldn’t last much longer.&nbsp; To tell you
the truth I’m a little surprised it lasted as long as it did.&nbsp; I kept it
to myself though of course, you know… in case I was wrong.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She
was back at her and Tobyn’s apartment with her friend Felix Parker.&nbsp; When
Tobyn had left she’d called him to pick her up and bring her here.&nbsp; They
were best friends and had been since grade school, since before he’d come to
understand that he was gay, since long before either of them had any kind of
romantic or sexual interests at all.&nbsp; As adults they continued to be very
close.&nbsp; Kathryn found that it could be hard for her to make friends with
men.&nbsp; It seemed that inevitably they’d always get around to trying to
sleep with her, and it was exhausting.&nbsp; Though she’d largely given up, she
would sometime still try, but sometimes she didn’t, either way though it always
seemed that when she thought she’d made friends with a man he’d inevitably
proposition her and she’d be left wondering if it had ever really been any kind
of genuine friendship at all, or if it had all just been one painfully
elaborate and drawn out attempt to get in her pants.&nbsp; In the aftermath,
everything that came before always came to appear like a subterfuge.&nbsp; It
had become hard to let men in at all if she didn’t have a prima facie sexual
and/or romantic interest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
is why since their adolescence she’d come to find such comfort in her genuine
and lasting friendship Felix.&nbsp; There was none of the rivalry she often
felt with other women, and yet there was none of the sexual tension she too
often felt with other men either.&nbsp; She could be absolutely secure in the
purity of their relationship.&nbsp; He was her best friend, and that was
that.&nbsp; He knew her better than anyone else in the universe, she sometimes
wondered if he knew her better than she knew herself.&nbsp; She sometimes
reflected on prone people are to understanding themselves so poorly compared to
those who know us well, but aren’t biased the way people are towards
themselves.&nbsp; So many blind spots, so many wishful delusions…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I
didn’t plan on it, it just… sort of happened.&nbsp; Yesterday he accepted the
mission I was on, and I figured things would be good.&nbsp; I was expecting to
be grounded for a long while after such a big mission.&nbsp; Hell… I figured
we’d be married by the time I went up again and that maybe he’d have mellowed
out a bit about it…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>But?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>But…
when he found out about my new assignment, the look in his eyes… well, I knew I
couldn’t have him and my career anymore.&nbsp; I had to choose.&nbsp; It was
just such a blatant dichotomy between how excited I was and felt perfectly
right to be, and how upset he was about it.&nbsp; Everything just became… way
too obvious.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m
sorry.”&nbsp; He was obviously much more sympathetic than disappointed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She shrugged, “it is what it is…” and continued stuffing
clothes into her luggage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
all do you have to pack up here?” Felix asked while looking around.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Not
much,” Kathryn said with a shake of her head and an angry thrust into the suitcase.&nbsp;
“Most of it is just… stuff, replaceable stuff.”&nbsp; She looked around.&nbsp;
“All of my irreplaceable are still in my deep storage boxes anyways.&nbsp; I
just need my clothes.&nbsp; He can keep the rest… I can leave him that at
least.”&nbsp; She zipped up her luggage.&nbsp; “That’s it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She’d stay with Felix for now, he had an extra room
anyways.&nbsp; “Want to be on my team?” she asked, trying to change the
subject.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Thought
you’d never ask,” Felix said with a big grin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Best
friend or not you’re still the best engineer at the agency.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He nodded his acknowledgement of the compliment.&nbsp; It
was the common view of most at the agency and he knew it.&nbsp; Most of the
time he was humble enough to not let it get to his head.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What’s
our next move then?” Felix asked as he held the door open for her and she
rolled her luggage out into the hallway and locked the door behind her.&nbsp;
She started to walk away, but a thought occurred and she returned to the door,
removed the front door and apartment keys off of her key ring, bent down, and
slipped the two keys under the door.&nbsp; “After that move?” she asked Felix
as she started down the hall again.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He winced a little on the left side of his face.&nbsp; “I
meant-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I know
what you meant Felix,” she said as she pressed the elevator door.&nbsp; Her and
Tobyn had lived about half way up one of the taller towers a bit out from the
downtown core towards the water.&nbsp; She was going to miss that apartment,
she reflected.&nbsp; From their balcony they’d had a great view of the
ocean.&nbsp; She took a moment to silently chastise herself for having such
shallow thoughts when she felt she should only be missing Tobyn himself.&nbsp;
It occurred to her with some mental discomfort that she was likely to miss the
apartment more than Tobyn.&nbsp; The mind wanders though…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We get
ready to accompany Jaren up to the New Horizon,” Kathryn said as the elevator
door opened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m
sure we’ll be expected to participate in the welcome ceremonies when he
arrives.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn wrinkled her nose.&nbsp; “Of course.”&nbsp; She
didn’t care much for that part of her job. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class=MsoNormal>Chapter 4</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathryn
stood at attention in her dress uniform only two spots down from the president
herself.&nbsp; They were standing on a permanent stage in Sengupta Park, the
large public green space across the street from the president’s
residence.&nbsp; Between the stage and the residence was a large open space
where the audience would normally be when this stage was used for music
concerts or play as it was built for.&nbsp; But today the whole large open area
in front of the stage was kept clear as a landing pad for Jaren’s ship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She
along with everyone else kept looking up into the sky expectantly, knowing that
his ship would come into view at any moment now.&nbsp; One of the president’s
aides pointed up into the sky for her, and Kathryn tried to follow her finger
but couldn’t see anything up there.&nbsp; Then there is was, at first just a
spec, barely even there.&nbsp; Once she was definitely able to detect it, the
craft fell so fast that many became alarmed at the possibility of a crash and
started looking around for where they could dash for cover if necessary, not
that it would help if things went down that way.&nbsp; But before anyone’s
bodies actually betrayed their fear with such a flight, the ship noticeably
decelerated to a near hover by comparison to its previous speed.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It
was silver and round, a flying disc wide in the middle and narrowed out towards
the edge.&nbsp; It was clear that whatever propulsion technology they were
using, the business end was in the middle of its underside, which inched ever
nearer the ground.&nbsp; A hundred meters up, three panels retracted from the
underside of the ship, and out of the void extended silver legs jointed in the
middle, poised to take up the weight of the spacecraft when it landed.&nbsp; It
hovered just above the ground and inched lower and lower until the three legs
all made contact with the ground at the same time, and then bent at the joint
under the weight as the craft settled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It
came to rest, and the myriad strange sounds coming from it began winding down
until before long it was rendered eerily quiet.&nbsp; Nobody on their planet
had ever seen any kind of craft or technology even approaching that
level.&nbsp; The near mythic founders of their colony, at their original height
of their technological power, had never come even close to the same
level.&nbsp; This left Kathryn with a growing sense of concern.&nbsp; Her
military (*?) instincts couldn’t help but take note of how helpless they’d be
if their guests decided to suddenly become hostile.&nbsp; She tried to shake
her suspicions away as merely the healthy paranoia she hoped it was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another
panel slid away from the underside, and a ramp extended from within.&nbsp; Once
fully extended, Jaren was seen emerging from the ship.&nbsp; He stood in the
threshold for a moment, and surveyed the scene before walking down the ramp
with remarkable confidence.&nbsp; As he proceeded down the ramp the crowd began
cheering loudly, and Kathryn could tell that he was clearly quite startled by
the noise of the crowd.&nbsp; He then seemed to understand, found a broad grin
on his face, and waved to the crowd with both arms over his head as he stepped
off of the ramp and onto the green grass.&nbsp; Looking behind him he saw the
President Kim and Kathryn on the stage and crossed underneath his ship towards
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not
content to wait, the president walked across the stage towards the stairs,
motioning for Kathryn to follow as she passed her.&nbsp; She dutifully followed
behind the president’s chief of staff and head of security.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laying
the diplomatic charm on thick, President Kim put on a big smile and extended
her hand to Jaren as they met just beyond the stairs to the stage.&nbsp; He
took her hand and she put her other hand over his as she had to Kathryn, and
then he did the same.&nbsp; Kathryn smirked and motionlessly shook her
head.&nbsp; ‘Politicians…’ she thought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Greetings,
Mr. Jaren.&nbsp; I offer you the warmest greetings from all of the people of
Haven.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Likewise
from the people of Kobol Madame President.&nbsp; And it’s Snow, Jaren Snow, but
please do feel free to call me Jaren.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh and
you must likewise call me me So-yi, I insist!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>As you
wish, he answered with another respectful bow of his head.&nbsp; May I address
the crowd So-yi”?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh,
I insist!” President Kim answered.&nbsp; She motioned the way with her hand,
and Jaren obliged, followed closely by the other four.&nbsp; He climbed the
stage and stood in front of the podium.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
crowd was abuzz, but when he stood before them and raised his hands they hushed
to near silence.&nbsp; “I bring you greetings from all of your brothers and
sisters on my homeworld!”&nbsp; The crowd cheered with greater volume than they
had at any point so far that day.&nbsp; “I thank you for your warm
greeting.&nbsp; I say today, that our species has been divided for far too
long.&nbsp; Today we take the first step of a journey together, a journey of
reunification, but I assure you, the best is yet to come…”&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Please,
tell us about your planet Jaren, we’re all very curious,” President Kim
urged.&nbsp; A few hours after his arrival, Jaren and his three teammates were
enjoying a state dinner hosted by the president and her top secretaries, as
well as Kathryn and the team she’d selected for their mission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Kolob?&nbsp;
Oh, it’s absolutely beautiful!&nbsp; If you make me talk about it too much
you’re going to make me homesick…” he playfully complained.&nbsp; “My people
live on a mid-latitude southern continent which is blessed with a great
mountain range spine running along the middle of it.&nbsp; Below this divide is
a cooler and wetter climate while the territory to the north is somewhat warmer
and drier.&nbsp; Most of us live in the north where we originally landed,
though now there is a significant city living on the southern coast.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Did
you find any sentients on your planet when you arrived?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Did
you??” He asked reflexively, seemingly shocked at even the suggestion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “We
found that there used to be here, which is why there was no indications in
original scans from Earth.&nbsp; That era on this planet had long since
passed.&nbsp; Whatever civilization they clearly once had, it collapsed long
before we ever arrived.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Amazing!”
Jeren’s male associate exclaimed.&nbsp; “As far as we knew humans were still the
only sentient species known to have existed!&nbsp; Were you able to find out
what happened to them?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Indeed,”
Elim Terey explained.&nbsp; He was the biologist, biochemist, and medical
officer Kathryn had selected for her team.&nbsp; “Well, we at least have a very
strong theory.&nbsp; We believe that they fell victim to a brain
parasite.&nbsp; Our ancestors were able to diagnose the contemporary effects of
their condition quite readily.&nbsp; We tried to help them, we hoped that
perhaps their original glory could be restored if we unburdened them of the
parasite, but it appeared that their brain had evolved in the interim around
the parasite, making such a thing impossible.&nbsp; We considered going one
step further and attempt to restore them genetically, but… our founders didn’t feel
it was right.&nbsp; We don’t question their wisdom, and regardless we no longer
have the technology to do so ourselves.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Are
you in contact with them?” Jaren excitedly asked.&nbsp; “It may be old hat to
you, but up until this moment as far as we were concerned humans were the only
known sentient species to have ever existed.&nbsp; I know a lot of people on
Kolob who would give their left arm for the chance to know everything you can
possibly tell them about them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Although
we have recently begun investigating the possibility of starting a new colony
elsewhere on the planet,” the president offered diplomatically, “up until now
we’ve restricted ourselves to our territory here to limit our incursion on
them, and the Squiddies so far seem content to leave us be in turn.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Squiddies?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Yes,
that’s what we call them.&nbsp; Our founders found much of the life here on
Haven reminiscent of what they knew as squids on Earth.&nbsp; They found this
planet dominated with life reminiscent of Earth cephalopods and reptiles,
thought they encountered nothing like mammals at all.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Fascinating…”
one of Jaren’s people remarked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What
kind of life did you find on Kolob?” Kathryn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Kolob
is almost entirely populated with something similar to mammals, from the small
irritants underfoot to the large majestic Keraziks which fly overhead.&nbsp;
There are insects and such, but anything larger are all mammal like though the
limited paleontology we’ve been able to conduct suggest that there used to be
far stranger and more varied kinds of like.&nbsp; Some planet wide calamity
seems to have occurred several hundred million years ago which we still don’t
understand, but after that point, only the one kind of large animal life
persisted.&nbsp; Like yourselves, our research has been limited by our
commitment to limit ourselves to our colony continent.&nbsp; Our authorities
have deemed the rest of the planet a nature preserve; only low impact
scientific expeditions are permitted.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “We
have a similar policy here on Haven,” one of the president’s secretaries
commented.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “How
did your arrival go for your people?” Felix asked him.&nbsp; “Our own people
had some… complications.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Well
I look forward to hearing all about that, but no, records show that our arrival
was actually relatively unremarkable.&nbsp; We found a good spot at the base of
the northern side of the continent, where the great river Moroni flows into a
vast flood plain.&nbsp; It was there that we made our home.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “And
today?&nbsp; How many people do you have today?” Elim Terey asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Our
last census counted over 18 million souls.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Wow…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “And
you here on Haven?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Just
under four million, split between our two beautiful twin capital cities,” the
president answered with pride.&nbsp; “We have so many questions Jaren, you said
you were in contact with the other colony as well?&nbsp; Can you tell us about
them?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Of
course, they Romans are… different from us.”&nbsp; It was clear that he was
trying to be diplomatically fair, but didn’t hold them in especially high
regard.&nbsp; “They are not focused on technological development the way we are
Madame President.&nbsp; We have perfectly amicable relations, maintain
embassies on each other’s planets, and collaborate where our mutual interests
align, but we have starkly different philosophies in a variety of
respects.&nbsp; They have rejected the high technology which we have
embraced.&nbsp; We have amicable enough relations, we both maintain embassies
on the other’s planets and we collaborate where our mutual interests align,
but… well like I said, they don’t seem to have much use for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “And
they were the Calothics?” Kathryn’s anthropologist, psychologist, and historian
Keri Reed asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Very
nearly Miss Reed, but they call themselves ‘Catholic, not Calothic.&nbsp; They
call their planet Roma.&nbsp; I haven’t had the pleasure of being there myself
but I hear it’s quite lovely where they settled.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>In
what way do your philosophies differ?” Kathryn asked.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>They
are an… introspective people.&nbsp; They concern themselves with harmony and
balance, and this leaves them with little interest in what we would consider
development.&nbsp; Their priority is to exist in a productive and mutually
beneficial partnership with the natural world.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Do
your people not have the same respect for the natural world?” Elim asked, with
some deliberate provocativeness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jaren
sighed as he pursed his lips and considered the question.&nbsp; “That would be…
an inaccurate description I would say.&nbsp; My people certainly understand
that our existence is contingent on a healthy natural environment.&nbsp; We
greatly value the utility of it.<span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The
utility?” Kathryn asked.&nbsp; “That’s all?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “No
Commander,” he answered.&nbsp; “The possibilities for the relationship between
humans and nature exists on a spectrum of impact.&nbsp; We seek to harness the
power of nature to our own needs to a far greater degree than the Romans do, as
you do as well I’ve observed.&nbsp; Our view is that danger only creeps in when
we forget that we as humans are ourselves an inseparable part of nature as
well.&nbsp; We must not exploit so far that it begins to harm us more than
benefit us.&nbsp; So yes, we value the utility of nature for us, yet we respect
its ultimate power over us, and our need to exploit it with all due caution and
respect.&nbsp; It is our position that a pure state of nature provides us with
a starting point, something we can take and improve upon, to perfect.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Does
that include your own bodies?” One of the president’s secretaries asked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “No,”
Jaren’s apparent second in command decidedly answered.&nbsp; “God created us in
his perfect image.&nbsp; To attempt to improve on our form would be a
blasphemy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Yes.”
Jaren conceded, but sounding far less moved by the sentiment.&nbsp; “A
blasphemy.&nbsp; That is what our people have traditionally believed, but there
is a growing movement who question that particular interpretation or our
scripture.&nbsp; I for one, count myself among them.”&nbsp; His officer shot
him an indignant look, but it was brief and seemed involuntary.&nbsp; It seemed
as though she concealed her reaction as soon as she’d become consciously aware
of it herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What
about Earth,” Kathryn asked, no longer able to contain her curiosity.&nbsp;
“All our people know is that they stopped transmitting halfway through our
journey here and were never heard from again.&nbsp; Have you been there?&nbsp;
Do you know what happened?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Earth…
is gone,” he answered somberly, to gasps and looks of shock around the table
before he clarified.&nbsp; “Everything it was, anyways.&nbsp; We don’t know
exactly what happened, but by the time we were able to reach it in order to
investigate why they wouldn’t answer our messages there was nothing left.&nbsp;
We didn’t bother to land because our observations from orbit showed that every
city had succumbed to at least several centuries of decay.&nbsp; We were able
to detect inhabitant, but… they were sparse, and far less developed than even
the Catholics.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “You
were there but you didn’t bother to land?&nbsp; You didn’t make any attempts to
contact those who were left at all?” President Kim exclaimed with great
surprise. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “We
really didn’t see the point,” Jaren answered with a shrug.&nbsp; “They’re stone
aged at best.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some
uneasy looks circulated around the Havenites.&nbsp; What happened to Earth was
the greatest mystery of all for their people.&nbsp; It seemed unconscionable to
them that they would make it all the way back to Earth only to lose interest
and not take the opportunity to investigate.&nbsp; Nobody wanted to press the issue
at the moment though, for risk of offending their guests.&nbsp; Instead, the
president raised her glass. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “To
our reunion,” President Kim cheerfully offered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “And
to a new story Madame President, a whole new era for the Human species, finally
all united again at last.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “To
reunion!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few hours later, Jaren and Kathryn found themselves alone
in one of the museums near the presidential residence.&nbsp; It was well after
regular hours, but special arrangements were made for their unusually high
profile guests.&nbsp; The two teams had split into pairs to explore the
exhibits more thoroughly.&nbsp; There had been alcohol served at the state
dinner and while they were both under the effects, it was moderate.&nbsp; They
were still buzzed, but nothing more.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was enough to render them
on the verge of flirtation, but not so much that they were unable to maintain
their overall professionalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>And
this is the main shuttle exhibit,” Kathryn informed him as she turned on the
lights to the large open room which housed the remaining now ancient shuttle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Wow…”
Jaren uttered.&nbsp; He seemed genuinely impressed.&nbsp; “And this thing
allowed you to go back and forth to New Horizon?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh
yes, for years and years after our arrival.”&nbsp; She caressed the hull
sentimentally as though it were some sort of faithful pet who’d been
respectfully put to rest a long time ago.&nbsp; It was an indulgence she’d been
wanting the chance to engage in.&nbsp; Ordinarily touching any exhibit in the
museums was strictly forbidden.&nbsp; “You didn’t have anything like this?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh no,
our means were much… well, cruder.&nbsp; Your mission was much more
methodically planned and crafted.&nbsp; Our people hollowed out a massive
asteroid, slapped some engines on it and just hoped for the best.&nbsp; We only
had crude one way landers when we arrived, and a lot of them even failed after
the long journey.”&nbsp; He seemed sad recounting this.&nbsp; “Our strategy was
overwhelming numbers as opposed to high technology.&nbsp; We made no provisions
for maintaining technological proficiency when we arrived, just tens of
thousands of people dumped on the planet to homestead and make a hard honest go
of it.&nbsp; Ironic perhaps that we so enthusiastically turned to technological
solutions now later on.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Not
ironic,” Kathryn suggested as she motioned with her hand for him to follow him
and entered the shuttle hatch.&nbsp; He followed as she made her way past the
flight deck bulkhead into the large rear section which was designed carried
either fuel of personnel depending on which direction it was going.&nbsp; She
sat down on one of the rows of plastic seats and pulled out of a pocket a small
bottle of the wine like drink they’d been having at dinner and opened it.&nbsp;
“It makes all the sense in the world actually.&nbsp; Your people no doubt had
remarkable hardships resulting from your lack of appreciation of technology and
that left a mark.&nbsp; You all remembered well how valuable technology is and
have a cultural drive to pursue it vigorously.&nbsp; So far that’s the thing I
respect most about your people.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She took a drink from the bottle as he sat down beside her
and she passed it to him.&nbsp; “And you only just met us,” he remarked
thoughtfully before taking a drink himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
president and I were very skeptical of you, you know.&nbsp; It all seemed too
good to be true.&nbsp; It still does actually.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I can
understand you feeling that way.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>But
you’re for real aren’t you?&nbsp; You really do come in peace don’t you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>As far
as I’m aware,” he said with a wink before taking another drink.&nbsp; “We may
dazzle you with our technological prowess Commander, but my people are far from
perfect.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Go
on,” she said, taking the bottle back from him and drinking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
enjoy making good, honest, and mutually beneficial deals, but…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>But?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>But I
wouldn’t say we’re particularly charitable.&nbsp; If you have nothing to offer
in return, it will be hard for you to get anything out of our government.&nbsp;
It’s not that we’re into hoarding or anything, it’s just… well, let’s just say
that things that we see no benefit for us in immediately have a very low
priority.&nbsp; The flipside though is that what does benefit us is considered
very high priority, hence why you can expect this operation to go very quickly
and smoothly.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>And
then?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>And
then like the Romans you can expect to be left pretty much to yourselves.&nbsp;
You’ll be welcome to exchange embassies, have access to the rift system… but we
won’t ask much of you, nor have much interest in advancing you.&nbsp; Not
maliciously, just… out of a lack of interest.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn tipped the bottle towards him.&nbsp; “Well I
appreciate the warning Jaren.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
about your people?” he asked.&nbsp; “Anything I should know about that I might
not pick up on readily through standard diplomacy?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yeah,
we’re coming for ya,” she said with widened eyes which feigned seriousness
which made Jaren chuckle.&nbsp; “But seriously, we’re not a people who will be
content to remain junior partners forever.&nbsp; I guarantee somewhere tonight
there are already wheels in motion to figure out how we can capitalize on this,
learn what you can teach.&nbsp; We’re ambitious Jaren, and we already want what
you got.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren took the bottle from her as he nodded somberly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m
not talking about aggression.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Of
course.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I only
mean that we’re going to want to develop for ourselves what you’ve shown us is
possible as rapidly as possible.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
we may not have much enthusiasm to help you do so directly Commander, but I can
assure you we will at least respect your initiative.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Also
good to know…” Kathryn reflected with a thoughtful nod.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class=MsoNormal>Chapter 5</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After
their tour of the museum, Jaren and his staff were provided with guest rooms in
the presidential residence.&nbsp; The next morning, Kathryn, Felix, Elim, and
Keri met up in front of Jaren’s ship.&nbsp; Kathryn was the only one of them
(not to mention the only Havening) to have gone to space so far, and she could
tell that the others were not necessarily afraid, but definitely anxious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Well
what do you think?” she asked the others.&nbsp; She was just trying to keep
things casual and make conversation while they waited for Jaren to show up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Well
myself I’m excited as the first day of school to get a good look inside this
space ship of theirs,” Felix enthused.&nbsp; “They’re obviously far more
advanced than even our founders were.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Do
you think we need to be afraid of them?&nbsp; Think there’s any chance of…
ulterior motives?” Keri asked.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Haven had not seen conflict since the first few days after
humans arrived, but the four were all members of the closest thing they had to
a military.&nbsp; They could best be described as paramilitary; they were
trained in weapons and tactics and while all taken very seriously, it was
nonetheless all understood as mere exercises meant to hone discipline and trust
in the leadership.&nbsp; Each member of the team had been on at least one
deployment already, but the missions they’d been on so far had always been
humanitarian in nature.&nbsp; Several years ago the twin cities had suffered a
horrific worst storm in the colony’s history, and all four of them along with
the entire rest of the service were deployed on a search and rescue mission,
and then later on in for the massive rebuilding efforts.&nbsp; Several hundred
people died that week, and it was the darkest period in their history since the
troubles following their arrival on the planet half a century earlier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn reached out and felt the cool metal of one of the
landing struts.&nbsp; “I don’t think so…” she said with a covert smile,
thinking about her conversation with Jaren late last night.&nbsp; “They came a
long way, and the way I see it… they’re really just so advanced that I couldn’t
imagine them being interested in anything we’ve made for ourselves, and any
natural resources they might want they clearly have the technology to find
elsewhere.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I for
one think it all just makes sense,” Keri added.&nbsp; “They just want the
archive.&nbsp; I could see how they would see it as the most priceless thing in
the universe.&nbsp; The fact that they didn’t just take it from us even though
they could have I think speaks volumes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Exactly,”
Elim said.&nbsp; “They could have taken it and we’d never even known they were
here until we got up there for ourselves and found it missing.&nbsp; It’s also
interesting that they claim to have waited long enough for us to reach the ship
for ourselves.&nbsp; If true, it betrays a certain…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He didn’t have the chance to find the right word to finish
his thought before they all nearly leaped clear out of their skin as a section
of the underside of the vessel pulled away and the boarding ramp extended. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Welcome!”
They whirled around to see that it was Jaren calling to them as he came down
the ramp.&nbsp; He startled them so because they were all waiting for him to
emerge form the presidential residence across the way, but somehow he’d beaten
them there.&nbsp; Kathryn was doubly surprised to see the president come down
the ramp with him practically arm in arm, and with no escort anywhere in
sight.&nbsp; Trust them as she might, that trust remained provisional and she
felt the president may be trusting and assuming too much too soon.&nbsp; They
were followed by Jaren’s crew, and as she suspected, not presidential security
detail.&nbsp; Looking around she could now spot the security personnel mulling
about, but it still made her uncomfortable for the president to have gone in
alone with them.&nbsp; She again tried to assure herself it was just healthy
paranoia.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Still a little startled, Kathryn forced an awkward
smile.&nbsp; She held out her hand as he approached and shook it.&nbsp; “Ready
to go?” he asked Kathryn with a warm smile as her team all nodded quite
eagerly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Wonderful!&nbsp;
Follow me then.” He eagerly marched back up the ramp, followed by his and
Kathryn’s teams.&nbsp; Before boarding, Kathryn turned to President Kim and
gave a respectful bow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Go
make us proud Commander Barnes.&nbsp; Rest assured that you are already a hero
to our people.&nbsp; Now you must go make yourself a legend.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn nodded while making intent eye contact, turned
around, and boarded the ship. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once onboard, Kathryn marvelled anew.&nbsp; The ship was one
big open area, save for the central core where she presumed the engine resided,
whatever it was.&nbsp; Jaren and his people were at their stations readying the
ship for launch, while her own people were standing around looking especially
useless.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Welcome
Kathryn,” Jaren offered without looking away from his control panel.&nbsp; You
and yours just have a seat and enjoy the ride…” One of his many taps at his
glass control panel unfolded four seats from the wall, and the four sat down
and fumbled through securing the harnesses which they were unfamiliar with.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Anti-matter
engine warmed up sir, we’re ready to lift off.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Anti-matter?”
Felix questioned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The man who increasingly appeared to be Jaren’s engineer
turned around in his chair to answer him.&nbsp; “Yes, you may call it something
else, but it’s the quantum inverse of normal matter?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yeah,
that… didn’t help any.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Have
your people discovered the atom?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>But
not the subatomic?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Only
in a very rudimentary sense.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Hmm.&nbsp;
Well, anti-matter is rare, but it can be created artificially and is the
inverse of normal matter in such a way that when a particle of it comes into
contact with a particle of normal matter the two annihilate each other and are
both converted into pure energy.&nbsp; For now you can just take my word for
it.&nbsp; We simply stream beams of matter and anti-matter towards each other
inside a thrusting bell.&nbsp; The energy released is focused away from us,
thus propelling us forward.&nbsp; Of course within an atmosphere only the
anti-matter stream is necessary.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Of
course.&nbsp; Well I believe I will have to take your word for it for now…”
Felix lamented.&nbsp; “But as soon as possible I want to know absolutely
everything about all of the things you just said.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That
could um… take a long time,” he said while trying not to sound condescending
and smiling at Jaren.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh
don’t you worry, I’ve got the whole rest of my life to figure it out.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Don’t
be alarmed,” Jaren warned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>About
what?” Felix asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His answer, was every surface of the interior of the vessel
seeming to go transparent.&nbsp; In reality, every interior surface was an
integrated display screen linked to a network of imagers on the exterior.&nbsp;
It was not a perfect illusion, but it was breathtaking nonetheless and the four
let out stifled gasps in response.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ignoring them, Irvina called out: “lift off in 3… 2… 1…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The acceleration was immediately noticeable, but it started
out relatively softly, and then steadily increased.&nbsp; Kathryn and her team
felt themselves pressed ever harder and harder into their seats.&nbsp; About
the time they were beginning to wonder if they should be concerned, Jaren
(apparently reading their minds) assured them: “This ship is capable of much
more in emergencies, but for standard ascents to orbit we limit ourselves to a
relatively comfortable three standard Kolob gravities.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The vibrations were moderate, but they hardly noticed.&nbsp;
They were too absorbed in the vision around them.&nbsp; They’d all been in
aircraft and seen their twin cities from a bird’s eye view, but after only a
couple minutes they were much, much higher than that, and the view changed as
the ship tipped over and began directing its acceleration laterally and away
from the city to achieve orbital velocity.&nbsp; The Havenites’ chairs were at
the high point of the ship’s circular shape as it sped around the planet, which
left them staring down in awe at their planet from two hundred kilometers above
the surface, racing over it faster and faster.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn had been up into space before already, but their
rockets which were so crude by comparison only granted her a small navigation
window in front of her, which never granted anything more than the briefest of
views of the surface.&nbsp; By the time she’d arrived at the New Horizon, she’d
been too absorbed in the ship to spare any thoughts of a glance over her
shoulder at the planet below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As though in a trance, they watched the surface race past
them faster and faster as they accelerated until the globe seemed to be falling
away from them.&nbsp; Twenty five minutes or so into their flight, Jaren
directed their attention away from the planet and towards the New
Horizon.&nbsp; “There she is…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>New Horizon had been left in a geostationary orbit at the
longitude of the twin cities to serve as a perpetual reminder of Haven’s
destiny.&nbsp; It was of course too far away to actually see the ship, but the
reflective metal of the hull made it shine brightly for all to see every dawn
and dusk.&nbsp; Now as they approached, all had the opportunity to see the ship
take form before their eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While Jaren’s ship didn’t seem to have any kind of
artificial gravity, which is really only a problem if you don’t have faster
than light capability, New Horizon’s most distinctive feature was its wide
habitat ring connected by four struts to the long narrow cylinder of the ship’s
central engineering section.&nbsp; The ring was designed to spin at the appropriate
rate to simulate gravity on the interior surface along its six levels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It got closer and closer for several minutes until its bulk
became clearly much greater than the ship they approached it in.&nbsp; Their
saucer ship flew along the length of the engineering section until it came to a
stop in front of one of the docking ports for the shuttle Kathryn had seen in
the museum more times than she could count.&nbsp; Slowly, painstakingly slowly,
they inched towards the airlock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
sent a scout drone to scan the surface of New Horizon soon after we established
the Esher in this star system.&nbsp; We believe we were successfully able to
create an acceptable docking port.&nbsp; Now we find out if we got it right…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He hovered his ship’s docking port, which now became clear
was at the very top of the saucer as they approached the larger ship, less than
a centimeter away from the New Horizon, and engaged the magnetic seals.&nbsp;
They all heard and felt a slight thunk as the two vessels became one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Ok,
and now the atmospheric seal…”&nbsp; A sheath only superficially similar to
rubber pressed against the hull.&nbsp; The magnetic seal was much more powerful
and allowed the material to press against the hull so firmly that it created an
airtight seal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Attempting
to pressurize,” Irvina reported, “and… confirmed, Jaren.&nbsp; We’re good to
go.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren swivelled his chair around to face the Haven
team.&nbsp; “We couldn’t match the hard crank seal we’re assuming is built into
the airlock,” he said as he started undoing his harness.&nbsp; The Havenites
took this as a cue to do the same.&nbsp; “There’s only about a one in ten
thousand chance that we could suffer a power loss catastrophic enough for the
backups to not compensate and lose the magnetic seal, but it’s a risk
nonetheless so we’ll minimize the time the airlocks are open.&nbsp; Let’s get
ready, get through, and close it up again.&nbsp; We have the ability to remote
pilot our ship if anything goes wrong, so we’re comfortable with all of us
disembarking.”&nbsp; He smiled as he saw the four of them struggle in the unfamiliar
absence of gravity.&nbsp; Kathryn had been in this situation before and was
more composed, but the others appeared to be attempting to swim through the
air, entirely in vain of course. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With a couple of taps at his panel, a part of the wall
screen beside him slid away and he pulled out Airburst Belts for all of
them.&nbsp; He gently pushed four of them in the direction of the Havenites and
passed the others out to his team.&nbsp; Kathryn and her people caught them as
Jaren explained: “put one block in front of you and one behind.&nbsp; Use the
buttons with arrows on them to move about, up, down, left, right, forward,
backwards… you’ll get used to it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When they all had their belts on, they assembled at the
airlock.&nbsp; Jaren tapped at a panel beside it, and the interior of the ship
went opaque again to its original appearance.&nbsp; The panel at the top of the
ship, which until now had been displaying the external image of the New Horizon
airlock, slid away to reveal the complimentary airlock of the ship they were
in.&nbsp; Jaren put his hands on the sturdy looking physical latch and his
other on the master release handle.&nbsp; “Ready?” he asked.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everyone nodded, so he pulled the release handle, swung the
latch bar, opened the circular portal, and ushered each person through before
climbing through himself and carefully closing the New Horizon’s hatch behind
him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Welcome
to New Horizon,” Kathryn offered, greeting him with a wide grin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class=MsoNormal>Chapter 6</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Alright,”
Jaren proceeded, “with Commander Barnes’ approval we’ll split up into
teams.&nbsp; Let’s pair up with one from each crew.&nbsp; Barnes you and I will
head to the fusion core and attempt to restart it.&nbsp; Irvina with Parker, I
need you two to stay here to assess the fuel situation, and transfer whatever
hydrogen and xenon from our ship which we’ll need to make the trip.&nbsp; Xion
and Reed, please head to the bridge and connect one of the anti-matter
batteries we brought to the main power bus of the ship.&nbsp; Attempt to power
up the ship’s systems, boot up the central computer core, and if possible
re-initiate the habitat ring’s gravity spin.&nbsp; Terrey and Nadelle please
head to environmental control in the arboretum.&nbsp; The air is good for now,
but before too long it will become toxic if we haven’t connected the
atmospheric cycler to the environmental system.&nbsp; Since the arboretum used
to do that job, the system is centralized there.&nbsp; Does that work for you
Commander?” he asked Kathryn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She
nodded her assent, first to Jaren, and then to her crew.&nbsp; “Shall we?” she
asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jaren,
Kathryn, and the two teams who were heading up to the habitat ring used their
Airburst Belts to make their way to the far end of the engineering section,
where the two sections of the ship were joined.&nbsp; By the time they’d
traversed the distance, the Havenites had already become quite proficient at
using the belts in the microgravity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Alright,
up you go.&nbsp; No need for the belts here,” Jaren offered, “just pull
yourself along with the ladder rungs there.”&nbsp; He and Kathryn watched as
the four people climbed into the tube and disappeared.&nbsp; They then proceeded
towards the central core room which was just beyond the access points to the
struts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathryn
watched as Jaren held up a small display screen and waved it in front of the
walls.&nbsp; What appeared on the display was the internal structure of the
walls, and he appeared to be looking for something.&nbsp; Seeming to have found
it, he pulled a panel off and attached a device to the wall beside the opening
he’d created, and clipped some connections between the device and the internal
wiring of the wall.&nbsp; The room lit up to an almost painfully brilliant
degree until her eyes adjusted and she could comfortably see the room around
her.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “This
small battery will only power up this room.&nbsp; We’ll need a lot more punch
to power up the core,” he explained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It
was a round room, with a spherical reactor in the middle which followed the
contours of the wall of the room.&nbsp; Opposite to the hatch they’d entered
through, there was another closed hatch, which gave a clear impression that it
hadn’t been in the original design.&nbsp; The portal they’d entered the room
through was beautifully moulded into the wall, whereas the other appeared to
have been cut through the contoured surface.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What’s
through there Jaren?” She asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now
curious himself after having been asked, he shone a laser beam at the hatch and
observed the read out on the device.&nbsp; “I don’t know… but on the other side
of that hatch is vacuum, so best not try to open it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jaren
turned his attention to the reactor in the middle of the room.&nbsp; It was
three meters across, and even though there was no indication of instability
(especially in the absence of gravity), being near it instinctively made
Kathryn conscious of the risk of being crushed by such a large and imposing
object.&nbsp; It was covered entirely by the same dull grey metal the rest of
the room was finished with.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathryn
watched as Jaren moved about it surveying, tapping at control panels and
shining his mysterious laser device at things.&nbsp; She’d never seen such a
device.&nbsp; She found herself somewhat amused as she watched Jaren go about
his work.&nbsp; It was a delight to watch him work, even if she didn’t
understand what he was doing, it was clear he knew exactly what he was
doing.&nbsp; He moved with a purpose and deliberate intent which she
appreciated in any fellow professional.&nbsp; It was the way she hoped others
observed her when she was intently at work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It’s
quite impressive,” he commented.&nbsp; “I mean… for fusion.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
do you mean ‘for fusion’” she asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well…”
he seemed as though he didn’t want to offend.&nbsp; “From our perspective
fusion power is a somewhat… antiquated technology,” he offered with a
shrug.&nbsp; “Don’t get me wrong, we still use it,” he offered almost
apologetically, “Mostly for grid level energy generation but that’s about
it.”&nbsp; He continued to investigate the device intently.&nbsp; “I can tell
you though that this is quite a remarkably advanced reactor design.&nbsp; In
fact, for the size and application, I doubt we could have engineered it any
better ourselves.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Are
you an engineer?” Kathryn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He smiled warmly at her.&nbsp; “I’ve been many things
Kathryn, as you have.”&nbsp; He went back to his work but continued, “I’ve read
your file of course, quite impressive…” he offered, and she got the impression
he was referring to more than her resume.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh and
by the way, I never really had the chance to congratulate you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>For
what?” she asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>For
being selected to come here first,” he answered without looking away from his
work.&nbsp; “Of all the people on your planet, you were selected above everyone
else to be the person to realize a singular and goal of your entire
civilization.&nbsp; You were deemed worthy of having your name be remembered by
your people for all time… very impressive indeed,” he explained with a clear
glance of admiration of her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
have me at a disadvantage Jaren,” she admitted, “There was no file to learn
about you.&nbsp; What do you do on your planet?&nbsp; What position do you
hold?&nbsp; What’s your professional background?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren smiled at her as he moved around to the other side of
the large sphere.&nbsp; It’s no secret,” he offered, “just remind me when we’re
back on my ship.&nbsp; I’d be happy to provide you with detailed personnel
files for all of us.&nbsp; As for me though, I was a research engineer until I
got bored with the minutia.&nbsp; I wanted work which had a broader scope so I
applied to the diplomatic corps and eventually worked my way into the highly
coveted inter-planetary division.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He came back beside her and tapped away at his pad as he
continued.&nbsp; “You might be surprised to know how much this all means to us
as well Kathryn.&nbsp; The day we made contact with Roma… was the happiest day
my people had known in a long, long time.&nbsp; When it was time, I fought hard
for this job and I was lucky to be selected for it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn was pleased at the reassurance that it meant a lot
to his people beyond just the access to their data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
fusion core appears intact…” he finally surmised.&nbsp; Do you know if it was
powered down before the last people left?&nbsp; Or did it just stop working at
some point and force you to abandon the ship?&nbsp; Did they ever have any
problems with it?” he asked her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>From
what I understand it ran continuously and operated flawlessly for over two
hundred years straight,” she answered.&nbsp; “I believe it was powered down
deliberately in the end when we put the ship to rest up here and finally
abandoned it for good.”&nbsp; She felt a hint of sadness at the idea of putting
the New Horizon to rest, even now after having returned to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Excellent…”
Jaren said.&nbsp; “Then in theory we just need to get it started again.&nbsp;
The anti-matter batteries should have no trouble doing that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What’s
the difference?” Kathryn asked, “I mean between the two technologies?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well…
if you don’t have any understanding of nuclear physics it would be hard to
explain in any detail,” he offered, trying not to sound condescending.&nbsp;
“You know about the different elements right?&nbsp; Oxygen, carbon, gold…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yup,
we know that much.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Alright,
well simply put, a fusion reactor like this takes atoms of the smallest element
hydrogen, and fuses them together into slightly larger elements like helium and
lithium.&nbsp; It takes a lot of energy to get them to do that, but when it
does happens you get even more energy out than you put in, and the excess you
can use to power a city or… a starship” He said with a wave of his hand about
them as he seemed to amuse himself with his ability to use the ship they were
in as an example.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
strength of fusion power,” he continued, “is its ability to operate
continuously basically forever just as this one did; it provides solid reliable
power output over long periods of time.&nbsp; It’s the same process which
lights the stars, and they keep burning for millions of years.&nbsp; It’s
weakness as a power source though, is its inability to punch a ton of power
through all at once.&nbsp; For that you need to pair it with a system of
capacitors.&nbsp; It can be done but it’s not natural to the technology and you
need to build up the charge over time in order to discharge it all at once.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>And
anti-matter?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Is…
almost impossible to explain if you don’t know anything about quantum
physics.&nbsp; Basically you just need to accept that there is normal matter
that makes up you and me, this ship and the planet below… but we can create a
different kind of matter which on the subatomic scale is the inverse of normal
matter.&nbsp; When the two kinds of matter interact with each other, they
annihilate each other and release tremendous amounts of energy in the process.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Guess
I’ll just have to take your word for it,” Kathryn lamented.&nbsp; She didn’t
like being told she couldn’t understand something.&nbsp; She liked it even less
when it appeared to be true.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Anyway,
that’s why we call them batteries and not reactors, because they are stored up
energy more than they are an energy generating system.&nbsp; They can be
discharged slowly or quickly, and that’s their advantage over fusion.&nbsp; We
use fusion power for the energy intensive process of creating and containing
anti-matter on an industrial scale.&nbsp; The batteries we brought with us, one
could power this whole ship at full power for a few hours and if need be we
brought enough to get us to through the Escher, or it can be discharged a lot
faster and used to juice up this reactor into a self-sustaining reaction.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn just nodded her head.&nbsp; She felt she at least
knew enough to believe that he knew what he was doing and that he had good
intentions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Speaking
of which… Xion?” he asked of the ceiling.&nbsp; “How are things coming in the
bridge?”&nbsp; He behaved as though he were hearing a response but she couldn’t
hear any.&nbsp; “Oh, yes, of course.”&nbsp; He tapped a few times at a control
panel.&nbsp; “Coming through now?” he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn heard Keri’s voice.&nbsp; “Commander Barnes?” it
asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes
Keri good to hear you.&nbsp; How are things going up on the bridge?” she asked
as she made her way over to the panel the sound of her voice was coming out of.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Very
well, we have one of their batteries hooked up into the grid and we seem to
have gotten primary systems up.”&nbsp; Kathryn watched as Jaren pulled his over
to the wall his smaller power device was attached to and disconnected it.&nbsp;
The room remained powered up and he smiled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Still looking at him, she reported: “Jaren says the core is
in good shape and he’s ready to attempt to initiate it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren looked up at the ceiling again.&nbsp; “Irvina?&nbsp;
Nadelle?&nbsp; Can you patch into the open channel in the ships’s comm system?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Sir?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Sir?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Excellent.&nbsp;
Irvina what is the status of the fuel system?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>They
were dry Jaren, bone dry.&nbsp; Xenon was down to point zero three percent,
hydrogen not much better.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Really?&nbsp;
Well that’s unexpected…” he observed as he turned to Kathryn with a quizzical
look on his face.&nbsp; “You were to be left with a significant reserve from
what I read.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We…
had some trouble along the way.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
see,” Jaren said with a shrug.&nbsp; “I look forward to hearing all about that
when appropriate.&nbsp; It’s a good thing we brought so much along with us
then.&nbsp; Have you transferred all the hydrogen and xenon we brought Irvina?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
just finished the transfer,” Felix answered over the comm line.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How’s
environmental coming Elim?” Kathryn asked the panel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We’re
almost finished installing the cycler they brought.&nbsp; I don’t know how, but
they claim that this thing can do the job of the entire arboretum.&nbsp; Well,
the air part anyways.&nbsp; I’m pretty sure it doesn’t grow any food.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amused, Jaren shook his head while wearing a smile.&nbsp;
“Apparently not Elim,” Kathryn informed him with a smile of her own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We’re
going to attempt to fire up the core.&nbsp; Irvina and Parker if you’re done
there head up to the bridge and help Xion and Reed get the rest of the main
systems up.&nbsp; Nadelle and Terrey please do the same when you’re finished up
there.&nbsp; If we’re successful here we’ll meet you all up there once I’ve run
my diagnostics.”&nbsp; He was met with a chorus of ‘understood’ and ‘yes, sir’,
and he closed the channel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Alright,
I am firing up the magnetic accelerators… and now we just have to wait a few
minutes while everything gets up to speed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn nodded.&nbsp; But after a few moments she spoke up
again.&nbsp; “Jaren, I need to ask you about something.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Shoot.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>My
people and I, we… didn’t know what to make of your… lack of curiosity about
what happened to Earth.&nbsp; For us, what happened to Earth, why they stopped
transmitting, is… the ultimate mystery, right up there with… how the universe
got started, whether or not any other colonies survived, or… what’s in the
centre of a black hole.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
that last one we actually solved,” he said with a chuckle.&nbsp; “But another
time I suppose.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How
can you be so obsessed, go to all this trouble to get your hands on the
archive, and yet have seemingly zero curiosity about how Earth fell?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren seemed contemplative if not concerned.&nbsp; “I would
think that the distinction between the two would be apparent.&nbsp; When my
people left Earth, we left everything behind.&nbsp; In hindsight, too
much.&nbsp; History, science, art, philosophy… everything which contradicted or
otherwise conflicted with our religious teachings was deliberately left
behind.&nbsp; In the intervening centuries we’ve changed a lot, and come to
discover what a mistake that was, what a tragic loss it was for us.&nbsp; What
we left behind, though we weren’t wise enough to see it at the time, was
ourselves, our history, all of the antecedence of what we had and would
become.&nbsp; The archives are our history, our past, our origins, everything
we so callously left behind so deliberately”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He sighed heavily.&nbsp; “It took centuries Kathryn, but
eventually we realized what we had done to ourselves, and we mourned.&nbsp; We
mourned that we had to start from scratch, but we took on the challenge with
the spirit of our pioneer ancestors.&nbsp; We reinterpreted our commandment to
be ever more like god, as a commandment to develop ever more god-like powers
through technology.&nbsp; As impoverished as we discovered ourselves to be
culturally, we also had an increasing sense of loneliness and isolation.&nbsp;
We lamented shutting ourselves off from Earth and the other colony planets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Another
thing Kathryn, a foundational dimension of our faith was the commandment to
spread it, to bring it to others to enjoy.&nbsp; This is an especially
fruitless endeavour on a planet where everyone is already the converted.&nbsp;
So, between our wish to find others to bring our faith to, and the fundamental
loneliness and isolation I know your people have suffered as well, we focused
our technological development on faster than light travel.&nbsp; What we came
up with, was the Escher.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>So
you’re here to convert us all?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He laughed out loud.&nbsp; “No, no… of course not.&nbsp;
Well, some of us will of course try but certainly not me and that’s certainly
not why we’re here today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It’s
not a coincidence that you showed up on the same day that I boarded New Horizon
is it?” Kathryn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
no…” Jaren answered with uncharacteristic sheepishness.&nbsp; “We sent a covert
scouting mission first to determine how amenable you would be to us showing up,
and to learn about you before introducing ourselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>And
what?&nbsp; You were afraid of us?&nbsp; Of how we’d react to you?” Kathryn
asked, inadvertently coming off as more defensive than she’d intended.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh no,
quite the contrary actually, we found you to be a most open and friendly
people.&nbsp; We knew you would be as excited to meet us as we would be to be
met by you.&nbsp; We could tell how alone you felt, and how much it cut you to
not know if any of the other colony missions had made it.&nbsp; What a weight
that must have been.”&nbsp; He reflected on it for a moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No,
no… the reason we resisted formal contact, was that we discovered how much the
New Horizon meant to you, how singularly your people had focused on reaching
it, and how close you were.&nbsp; It just felt wrong to swoop in at the last
moment and steal that glory from you.&nbsp; After some heated deliberation and
soul searching, the decision was made to wait until you had reached the ship
for yourself, and only then show up to introduce ourselves.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Part
of me wishes you hadn’t waited… but another part is glad you did.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
were very divided on it ourselves.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
still haven’t answered my original question though, why the complete lack of
interest in the Earth of today.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
it’s not for any overriding reason.&nbsp; We have launched some basic
reconnaissance missions.&nbsp; A few even went down to the surface to meet the
locals, but they were… well, primitive.&nbsp; I don’t mean to sound that
condescending, but they didn’t seem any more interested in getting to know us
as we did them.&nbsp; All scientific study of Earth and the rest of the solar
system is more easily gathered from this ship’s archive.&nbsp; We’re just far
more interested in what it was like before we left than learning about the
wasteland it has become, so missions like this came to take much higher
priority over time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She was beginning to understand, and remembering their
conversation the night before was coming to suspect that they were simply
technological chauvanists.&nbsp; There was no technology or data on Earth they
could use, and they had no other interest in the place. &nbsp;Haven’s level of
technological development was far inferior technology to that of Kobol, but
they respected how hard Haven had been working at it, how strong of a
technological upswing they were on, and that the ship which had brought them
here was so technologically advanced for its time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>If you
and yours are more interested in Earth than my people are, you’ll find much
common interest in that regard with the Romans.&nbsp; They have a permanent
embassy on Kolob, I’d be happy to introduce you to them when we arrive.&nbsp;
I’m sure you’d get full diplomatic honours as your people have graced us with.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
are they like?” she asked, “The Romans.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh
they’re good people, just very… well, contemplative compared to us.&nbsp; They
value harmony and wisdom over what we would consider advancement.&nbsp; They
brought a lot more technological know-how with them, so they didn’t have to
start as far back as Haven or Kolob but their progress is slow.&nbsp; You could
say that they prefer to study while we prefer to build, though I doubt they’d
frame it in quite the same way.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I just
realized that I’m actually going to get to see your planet, and meet them, and
see everything else… it’s hard to imagine.”&nbsp; She’d understood that this
was the mission, but she hadn’t stopped to think about everything that was
going to entail, the wonder of it beyond the challenge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Hold
that thought Kathryn.&nbsp; Everything’s cycled up, we’re ready for the final
phase.”&nbsp; He tapped the comm panel.&nbsp; “Bridge, how are we looking?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Everything
is nominal Jaren, and we’ve got plenty of juice for you to punch through.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Excellent.&nbsp;
Stand by.”&nbsp; Monitoring the display panels over his head, Jaren started
counting down.&nbsp; “Three… two… one… firing up secondary accelerators.&nbsp;
We need a hundred percent on this monitor to initiate self-sustaining fusion,”
he pointed while explaining to Kathryn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Together they watched and heard Xion count up the
numbers.&nbsp; “Ninety-six, ninety-seven, ninety-eight… ninety-nine…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They both held their breath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>One
hundred percent.&nbsp; The reaction appears stable.&nbsp; Congratulations
Jaren.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren pulled Kathryn towards him and hugged her
tightly.&nbsp; Her startle at the unexpected gesture gave way to her enjoyment
of it and she hugged him back in celebration. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class=MsoNormal>Chapter 7</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Five
hundred years…” Felix muttered to himself as he poked around the kitchen
adjacent to the main communal dining hall of the ship.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was eerie to be here; he’d dreamed about being on the New
Horizon his whole life, and he’d always imagined it as being very exciting, but
it was a little disorientating to be confronted with such mendacity and
eeriness simultaneously.&nbsp; He certainly didn<span lang=JA style='font-family:
"游明朝",serif'>’</span>t believe in ghosts or any such thing, but he nonetheless
felt a distinct presence here.&nbsp; It was a place where hundreds of people
had come and gone from this place for hundreds of years.&nbsp; It wasn’t just
these particular rooms either, in every place on this ship he could feel the
distinct weight of its history.&nbsp; Sure it had been almost five centuries
since anyone had been on the ship, but for the two centuries before it had been
the entire world for a great many people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Felix?”&nbsp;
He nearly jumped out of his skin when Kathryn said his name from behind.&nbsp;
She couldn’t help herself when she saw his reaction and she laughed out loud
before settling down and becoming much more sympathetic and apologizing for
having startled him.&nbsp; “Sorry about that…&nbsp; It’s creepy in here isn’t
it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Can
be,” he answered coolly, trying to regain some dignity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
are you doing in here?” she asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Just
poking around, really… as curious as I am just to see these parts of the ship,
I’m just as curious to see what half a millennium does to a place.&nbsp; I find
it oddly well preserved.&nbsp; I suppose I should have expected as much though,
given the vacuum.&nbsp; It<span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>’</span>s
kept everything pretty well preserved.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Any
food?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Felix laughed.&nbsp; “No, no of course not.&nbsp; Anything
usable was brought to the surface when the ship was abandoned, but anything
left behind wouldn’t be much use now anyways, even with the vacuum.”&nbsp; He
continued pawing at the random containers and equipment left behind for one
reason or another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They were on their way now.&nbsp; Having successfully
powered up the ship and getting all of the required systems operating,
President Kim had authorized their mission to Kobol.&nbsp; They’d made one more
trip down to the surface to bring up all of the supplies they would need for
the multi-week trip.&nbsp; They’d been given their last final orders and
instructions, and wished well on their trip.&nbsp; The president had impressed
on them all that although none were formally trained diplomats, diplomacy was a
fundamentally primary element of this mission.&nbsp; Although they were trained
engineers and scientists, as was required for such an intrepid mission, in the
end they were first and foremost first emissaries from their world to another,
in a process of first contact.&nbsp; They’d had several meetings each with
chief diplomats in the President’s inner circle.&nbsp; Each seemed envious of
the opportunity Kathryn’s team had been given, yet at the same time quite
content to be avoiding the danger and uncertainty of the mission.&nbsp; The
diplomats weren’t necessarily explorers, but in this case the explorers were
required to function as diplomats.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It took the better part of two weeks for the New Horizon to
break away from its orbit around Haven and make its way inward towards the
planet’s star where the Escher rift facility was located.&nbsp; The first third
of their trip was spent in a maximum acceleration phase towards the sun, but
the rest of the trip was spent accelerating laterally to the star to put them
into a stable orbit around the star.&nbsp; As the ship fell closer and closer
towards the sun, the increased lateral orbital speed slowed their actual
descent towards the sun.&nbsp; After the two week trip they found themselves
orbiting a few hundred kilometers out from the giant artificial crystal which
spawned the actual Escher rift.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren had explained along the way (as best as the Haven crew
could be made to understand), that thousands of solar energy collecting units
were swarming all about the sun.&nbsp; When activated, they each unit unfurled
into much larger apparatus, and all streamed their individually collected
energy into higher compiling satellites, which in turn fed the energy further
up into four massive compilers which always orbited in a line of sight
formation with the massive kilometer wide crystal Escher sphere.&nbsp; When
that massive amount of solar energy poured into the crystal all at once, its
molecular structure temporarily exploded into an energy rift which created a
tunneling wormhole to any other star with a similar infrastructure established
around it, where a similar complimentary process occurred.&nbsp; Kathryn’s
people didn’t understand the physics at all, but they came to understand the
process and effect well enough. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Along the way, both crews had a wonderful time exploring the
ancient ship and learning its secrets.&nbsp; The Haven crew roamed the ship
with a deep reverence, since for them it was Olympus abandoned, the mountaintop
home of the gods now deserted centuries ago.&nbsp; Beyond their reverence for
the history and significance to their culture, they also marvelled at the technology
on the ship.&nbsp; Though still significantly advance by comparison, it was
much closer to their own level of technology than Jaren’s ship had been.&nbsp;
Where the Kobol ship seemed practically magical to them, the New Horizon
technology was more within their grasp, easier to understand the principles
behind the technology.&nbsp; They found much of it to be fully developed
iterations of things which were either very basic, experimental, or at least
theoretical back home.&nbsp; The things which were flatly beyond them, they
found the Kobol crew quite happy to explain to them as best they could.&nbsp;
Felix, Elim, and Kerry sometimes felt like they were learning more from the
ship and the Kobolians in these two short weeks than they had in all the time
they’d spent in university on Haven. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two crews had largely paired off according to their
mutual interests and professional specialties, and had become friends over the
two weeks of travel.&nbsp; As much as the Haven crew were fascinated with how
advanced the ship was, the Kobol crew were interested in it as an artifact of
history.&nbsp; They explained that their own much cruder starship which had
brought them to Kobol, carved out of the interior of an asteroid, had been
directed into the sun soon after their arrival.&nbsp; They took on the same
note of sadness when relaying the story as they always did when they recounted
the tragic short-sightedness of the founders of their colony.&nbsp; It was much
the same as when the Haven crew recounted what they could remember of the
stories told of the conflict which broke out between factions of the crew as
soon as they arrived in orbit, and the social conflicts which brought it about,
begun much further back in their long journey.&nbsp; It always made them sad to
think of how far they were knocked back because of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn and Jaren spent most of their waking hours together,
touring the ship and diplomatically sharing important information about each
other’s cultures.&nbsp; Kathryn had never had much interest in a diplomatic
phase of her career, but it was on the shortlist of things she thought she
might be able to turn to some day when she couldn’t do the kind of work she
really wanted to do, along with politics.&nbsp; For better or worse, that was a
primary element of her current mission, she was effectively the lead ambassador
of Haven to Kobol.&nbsp; Keeping this in mind forced her to keep an appropriate
professional distance from Jaren despite them working so closely
together.&nbsp; She recognized that it could easily be her imagination, but she
sensed the same from Jaren, that he was feeling the need to keep things more
professional with her than he’d like to in other circumstances.&nbsp; They’d
shared a moment that first night in the shuttle, and ever since they’d been
spending more time together than they probably needed to professionally, but
under a professional justification for doing so.&nbsp; They had become quite
close, even had some remarkably personal late night conversations about what
had happened with her and Tobyn, how he had been married to Irvina a long time
ago and how now they were quite close friends.&nbsp; She appreciated and
respected his willingness to be good friends with a woman, even if it was only
in the wake of a romantic entanglement.&nbsp; She felt the maturity required to
foster that kind of relationship bode well for his overall emotional
maturity.&nbsp; She was also forced to admit that as things stood presently,
she didn’t feel that she’d ever care to foster the same kind of friendship with
Tobyn.&nbsp; The more she reflected on it with time and distance and in
conversation of the two weeks with Felix and Tobyn, the more she came to the
conclusion that they had always been a poor match from the very beginning,
they’d just been too young, naiive, and immature to realize it and before long
inertia took over and it took too long for either to have the werewithall to
finally end it.&nbsp; This revelation had left her with the occasional acute
bout of depression about wasted time, but her old and new friends comforted her
that no time was wasted so long as we learn and face the future with eyes
opened wider.&nbsp; In more existential bends in their late night
conversations, Jaren suggested to her that the experience for better or worse
had contributed to making her the woman she was today, and to will away such a
substantial part of her past would be to will away the person it left her in
favour of another version of herself, that to regret such a big part of oneself
is to wish away one’s own existence in a sense.&nbsp; There were a few moments
when she realized that she’d never had moments like this with Tobyn and it
simultaneously made her want to cry and kiss him, but managed to resist both
impulses and instead say goodnight to instead lie awake in bed thinking.&nbsp;
It had been too long since she’d had this much time to reflect on her life.&nbsp;
She felt like her spirit was getting the good rest and rejuvenation it had
needed for too long.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The night before they were to enter the rift, lying in bed
she admitted to herself that she was falling in love with Jaren, if she hadn’t
already, she chuckled to herself.&nbsp; She wasn’t sure what this meant, but
she felt it was an important admission to make to herself, important to not
deny or be afraid of it.&nbsp; She knew that could only impair her otherwise
good judgement.&nbsp; She was a professional, and she’d worked very hard all
her life to get to this place in her career.&nbsp; It had been such an
affirmation of the value of all her hard work to be selected out of everyone
else in the world to be the first to return to the New Horizon.&nbsp; She
didn’t want to deny herself what she was feeling, but she also knew she had to
be careful about how she proceeded.&nbsp; It seemed obvious that while on the
current mission it would be inappropriate to act on her feelings if they were
reciprocated.&nbsp; She’d have to maintain a veneer or professionalism at least
that long, and then see how she felt then.&nbsp; She was also mature enough to
understand that although it didn’t feel that way, there was always a chance
that what she was feeling was only a rebound effect from having so recently
separated from someone she’d until so recently thought she’d marry.&nbsp; She
didn’t think so, but… well, she wouldn’t either way, would she?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In their conversations Kathryn had learned that Jaren came
from a family of some privilege.&nbsp; His grandfather had been a member of
their colony’s senate, and his own father had ascended all the way to the
height of power and become President of their colony<span lang=JA
style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>’</span>s government.&nbsp; Jaren explained
though that he himself had turned his back on all of that, and had never wanted
anything to do with politics.&nbsp; He’d spent much of his youth exercising his
privilege to discover himself and his world, backpacking around some of the
less travelled places of Kobol and seeing the most important sights to see on
the planet.&nbsp; It was in this phase of his life that he discovered his
passion for exploration and adventure, and when he felt the time was right to
gain some more direction in his life, he’d joined the diplomatic corps of their
space fleet, soon after meeting Irvina and falling in love.&nbsp; After many years
he’d worked his way up to the position of being a leading candidate to lead the
New Horizon expeditionary team.&nbsp; It also seemed important to him to
elucidate that all through his career he resisted getting or taking any
advantage or special treatment out of coming from the family he did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other crew members had likewise teamed up according to
their interests.&nbsp; Felix had been spending a lot of time with Irvina, who
was also Jaren’s second in command.&nbsp; She had was his lead engineer and
seemed to quite enjoy teaching Felix all about the technology of the New
Horizon and bringing him up to speed as best she could on all of the ship’s
systems.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This was common in all of the pairings, Jaren’s people
seemed to quite enjoy enlightening Kathryn’s people.&nbsp; Nadelle and Elim for
example spent quite a bit of time in the medical bay examining the surgical
pods and chatting about the medical advances the people of Kobol had been able
to make.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Keri and Xion hardly ever left the archive room, to the
point that they had to be brought food or they’d forget to eat, and also
needing to be reminded that sleep was occasionally necessary for human beings,
to the degree that at one point Jaren and Kathryn had to order them to get some
sleep.&nbsp; Xion had a similar humanities background as Keri, and had been
waiting years on end for the chance to learn what happened on Earth after the
Mormon generational starship left Earth.&nbsp; Keri had had access to the
information left them in library drone, but was immensely enjoying learning all
about Kobol and its culture and history since leaving Earth.&nbsp; For the
people of Haven, what happened to Earth had been the only mystery greater than
what became of the other colony ships which had launched before New Horizon
did.&nbsp; Both were savouring the satisfaction of being able to fill in
critical gaps in their understanding of the great human narrative, the greatest
story ever told, from early cosmology, to star and galaxy formation, to planet
formation, to life and intelligence, and all leading to the extra solar
colonization that gave rise to their respective civilizations.&nbsp; Nothing
could be more exciting for either of them than filling in these missing
chapters of that great epic, and they were loathed to having to resign
themselves to such a temporally wasteful activity sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As planned, as they approached the star, it became necessary
for Jaren and Irvina to augment the New Horizon’s artificial magnetosphere with
technology from their own ship.&nbsp; New Horizon’s own field was only designed
to adapt to the relatively low level of cosmic and solar radiation at the
distance from a star of its planets.&nbsp; The Escher technology required
getting much closer to the sun and required a far more powerful magnetic shield
to deflect the intense radiation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The closer they got to the sun, the more both crew spent
time in the zero gravity bubble marvelling at the sight.&nbsp; This sphere of
synthetic material was what turned out to be ahead of the reactor core room
where Jaren had detected vacuum.&nbsp; The inhabitants of the ship had constructed
as a zero gravity playroom and observatory en route.&nbsp; Although the need
had never been anticipated by the original inhabitants, the advanced materials
the bubble had been constructed of incorporated adaptive shielding as a safety
measure.&nbsp; The bigger and brighter the star became in their field of view,
the more the material of the bubble darkened, which not only prevented
immediate and fatal burning of their skin, but it also allowed them to look
directly at the star without damaging their eyes.&nbsp; Looking into it was
positively hypnotic; the closer they got to it, the more detail they could see
at its apparent surface, the roiling and bubbling surface of the massive
nuclear fireball raging before them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The crystal only finally came into view the day they were to
enter the rift, and although they knew it was a brilliant violet from schematic
pictures provided by the Kobolians, the darkening of the bubble required at
such an extreme proximity to the star left it appearing only black in contrast
to the star when it finally came into view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As they looked around, they saw the star appear to
noticeably darken as the unseen collectors unfurled and began absorbing the
energy of the star’s light.&nbsp; Streams of unfathomably brilliant light began
crisscrossing over the surface of the sun until four frighteningly and
impossibly massive pillars of light all converged on the crystal all at once
right before them.&nbsp; The crystal literally exploded into a massive field of
energy hundreds of kilometers wide, diffuse at the edges but an infinitely
bright purple colour at its core as they sailed directly towards it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As they passed into the centre of the vortex, they felt a
shudder and disorienting rush of colours all about them.&nbsp; The
disorientation soon passed as the forward half of the bubble slowly began to
undarken to reveal the blackness of space behind a field of stars which
gradually came into view.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren welcomed the Havenites to the Eta Cassiopeiae
system.&nbsp; As the rest celebrated and cheered, Kathryn hugged Jaren with a
lingering tightness which was a little indulgent, but not so much as to
altogether be inappropriate given the situation.&nbsp; He hugged her back just
as warmly, waiting for her to finally break the embrace, and it was at that
point she was certain that for better or worse, her feelings were reciprocated
whether acknowledged or not.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class=MsoNormal>Chapter 8</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>After exiting the rift, New Horizon was greeted by a small
fleet of ships which were waiting to greet them on the other side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Are
they all here for us?” Kathryn asked Jaren.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Some,”
he acknowledged, “but not all.&nbsp; There is a constant contingent stationed
at the rift to render aid if any incoming ships should require it, as well as
to deal with any… unexpected guest which might show up.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Unanswered
guests?” Felix asked in surprise.&nbsp; “You mean like… hostile aliens?&nbsp;
An invasion?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren laughed.&nbsp; “Some people do consider it a
possibility yes, if an outside one.&nbsp; Of course it’s never come up, I
assure I would have mentioned it by now if it had, but the small fleet permanently
stationed here would be the first to greet them whatever their
intentions.&nbsp; There is after all no way to prevent anyone from coming
through other than destroying our crystal but like I said it’s never come
up.&nbsp; We are currently drafting plans for a permanent space station here to
supplant some of the ships, but no construction has actually begun yet.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Anyone
else in the universe with similar technology,” Irvina added, “could in theory
lock on to our crystal quite easily but like Jaren said, so far it’s never come
up.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It
occurs to ask,” Keri brought up, “have you set up rift crystals anywhere
besides Earth and the colony planets so far?&nbsp; If you’ve had the chance to
do so around these planets…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Not
yet,” Irvina answered, “but the process is underway.&nbsp; We have drone rift
construction ships underway to half a dozen systems with promising planets, but
none have made contact so far and we don’t expect to hear back from them for
years yet.&nbsp; Our first priority of course was the other colony planets.&nbsp;
Not only did we want to know if anyone else had survived, but…” she trailed off
as though she hadn’t meant to divulge what she was going to say and
reconsidered on the spot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren finished her thought for her without concern.&nbsp;
“If you hadn’t made it we at least knew that there was definitely a planet in
that system which could be colonized if you hadn’t been able to.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Right,”
Kathryn acknowledged.&nbsp; “It makes sense.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It’s
pretty ambitious,” Felix said, “to have sent out all of those drones
already.&nbsp; What have you got planned for those systems?&nbsp; You’ve made
it clear that your people aren’t very interested in exploration for
exploration’s sake.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
if there are any plans for those systems, they’re over our pay grade,” Jaren
answered dryly with what appeared to be a hint of bitterness, but then he
shrugged.&nbsp; “It’s just a long term process.&nbsp; If we wait to establish
the rift until we have plans those plans will immediately be delayed by
decades.&nbsp; It’s basic capacity building at this point.&nbsp; Once we have
the network established, if we find something useful or come up with plans, the
capacity is already right there in front of us.&nbsp; It’s a very resource
intense process to set up a portal in a new system, but our government has set
up a continuing budget for the project.&nbsp; We’re currently aiming for a
cadence of one new drone ship launch every year.&nbsp; So far we’re on
schedule, and every new rift we set up creates a new and more distant launch
point.&nbsp; One of the things our government will want to negotiate with yours
is the launch of such ships out of your system.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I had
no idea your people were so ambitious,” Keri commented as bright multicolour
lights began exploding in front of them between the New Horizon and the ships
they could see.&nbsp; “What’s that?” she asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Fireworks,”
Nadelle explained.&nbsp; “Of a sort.&nbsp; It’s a way of saying welcome, and of
celebrating our arrival.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Welcome
New Horizon, we’ve been expecting you,” A voice was heard over a loudspeaker
back at the entrance hatch to the bubble.&nbsp; “The people of Kobol celebrate
your arrival and offer warm greetings.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren led Kathryn back to the hatchway using their airburst
belts.&nbsp; He tapped at the panel and gestured Kathryn towards it with his
hand.&nbsp; “Thank you, to whom and I speaking?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>This
is Admiral Velora, commander of the Kolob Space Fleet flagship Utah.&nbsp; With
your permission we have tow ships which can attach to your vessel and get you
to Kolob in approximately seventy hours.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn raised an eyebrow at Jaren and he nodded his
approval.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s…
very kind of you, thank you,” she offered with a slight shrug.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Very
well, please retract the bubble structure forward of your main engineering
section.&nbsp; As it is currently deployed it blocks the grapple point on your
ship we have deemed structurally preferable.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Will
do, please stand by.”&nbsp; She turned around to face the others.&nbsp;
Alright, that’s us.&nbsp; Everyone out.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She ushered everyone out of the bubble and back into the
engineering section of the ship.&nbsp; “Let’s all head up to the bridge,” she
suggested as she followed Jaren out and firmly closed the hatch behind them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once on the bridge they all watched on the external cameras
as four vessels approached.&nbsp; They seemed little more than scant skins of
ships wrapped around massive antimatter engines like the ones on Jaren’s ships
only much larger and more powerful.&nbsp; One by one they anchored to the
engineering section of the New Horizon and then pulled away with just enough
engine power to pull the thick cable taught and hold position at the correct
distance.&nbsp; Once all four had done so they cleared departure with Kathryn
on the bridge, and then all four mighty engine ships gradually powered up to
full power and along with their escort ships all gradually pulled away from the
sun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The realities of orbital mechanics forbid a direct flight to
the planet, instead the thrust was directed towards increasing the distance of
their orbit from the sun ever outward until they could meet up with the orbit
of Kobol.&nbsp; Under New Horizon’s own power it would have taken more than a
month to reach the orbit of Kobol, fighting the gravity of the sun as they
were, but with their powerful tow ships attached, it would only take them a few
days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although there were occasional operational communications
between the ships in their small fleet, nobody boarded or exited the New
Horizon.&nbsp; The president of Kobol had left clear instructions that after
Jaren and his people, he wanted to be the first to greet the visitors at their
official ceremonial reception in the capital.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These three days seemed to drag on much longer than the two
weeks it took to initially reach the rift.&nbsp; They now felt familiar with
the ship enough that it was no longer exciting just to be there.&nbsp; They
kept working at their research diligently, but their minds now kept wandering
to what lay ahead, to the new planet they’d be seeing so soon.&nbsp; Also on
their minds were the incredible responsibility of only the four of them
representing their entire civilization to the people of the entire planet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The days dragged on, but passed nonetheless.&nbsp; Before
long they could see Kolob appear before them.&nbsp; A tiny speck at first, but
it grew larger and larger over the course of the last day.&nbsp; As they
approached they were able to see as well the small moon which orbited around
it, which was roughly half the diameter of Earth’s moon, and which orbited at
about two thirds the distance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once the tow ships had inserted the New Horizons into an
orbit around the planet, they detached and wished them a safe descent.&nbsp;
Once detached, Kathryn and her crew couldn’t resist reinflating the bubble and
having a clear look at Kobol from orbit.&nbsp; It was a beautiful view, but
with odd geography.&nbsp; There was a vast global ocean which circumvented the
entire equator with massive landmasses capping both poles, each approximately a
third of the way down to the equator from the poles.&nbsp; The regions which
bordered the oceans appeared rich and lushly green, while some distance inland
there were some arid yellow-orange regions and beyond them only white all the
way to the poles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Beautiful
isn’t it?” Jaren asked Kathryn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It is
certainly an… interesting geography.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes…
it actually leaves us relatively little land area on which we can settle.&nbsp;
We’re certainly nowhere near capacity, but…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren never finished his thought.&nbsp; He was distracted by
the beauty of his home planet.&nbsp; For several minutes he and Kathryn floated
in silence together looking down on the planet as it raced past them.&nbsp;
“Are you ready?” he eventually asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>As
I’ll ever be…” she answered distantly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The eight person crew gathered up what they would need from
the New Horizon and boarded Jaren’s smaller ship.&nbsp; After consulting with
aerospace control on his planet, Jaren disengaged his ship from New Horizon and
descended down to the planet below.&nbsp; Although atmospheric braking was
required to slow them from orbital velocity, the ship was sufficiently advanced
that they hardly noticed.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Through barely noticeable vibrations, Felix asked Irvina if
they used ablative materials to slow the ship down the way New Horizon’s
shuttles had, but she informed him that this had not been necessary for some
time.&nbsp; Their engines were sufficient to slow their velocity incredibly,
and to the point that the advanced materials the hull of the ship was
constructed of could withstand the extreme friction of re-entry without
ablating away.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After slowing to reasonable speeds, the ship rapidly soared
through the air across the vast ocean until the city on the shore came into
view and grew larger and larger as they approached.&nbsp; The city glittered to
the point of appearing to be made entirely of light, but as they approached
they saw that it was only an illusion created by all of the tall tower
buildings being encased in glass, which reflected the sunlight amongst
them.&nbsp; As they got closer they could see that each building had a metal
lightning rod on the top of it in the shape of a figure in robes blowing a
simple straight trumpet up into the air.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They approached a large clearing surrounded by towers
encased in green glass.&nbsp; It was a large parkland with trees and grass
sporting a landing pad to one side, vaguely reminiscent of the park Jaren’s
ship had landed in back on Haven.&nbsp; As they landed Kathryn could tell that
there was something different about the building across the street from where
they were landing.&nbsp; There were hundreds of people gathered a respectful
distance from the ship, excluding a pathway from between where the ship landed
and the steps leading up to what appeared to be a central tower.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ramp extended from underneath Jaren’s ship as the door
opened for them.&nbsp; Jaren urged Kathryn to go ahead and exit the ship
first.&nbsp; As she made her way down the ramp she was so startled by the
eruption of cheers from the crowd that she nearly fell over and off the side of
the ramp.&nbsp; Jaren came up from behind her and put his hands on his hips to
steady her.&nbsp; It was the most intimate physical contact they’d had so far,
and she savoured it for the briefest of moments as she looked back at him to
thank him.&nbsp; She quickly composed herself and together they&nbsp;&nbsp;
Together they walked down the rest of the ramp followed by the rest of
Kathryn’s crew followed by Jaren’s, and headed towards the steps.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn reached the stairs and began climbing towards the
person whom she could only assume was the Kobol president, flanked as he was by
various aides on either side.&nbsp; She was momentarily struck by the
similarity of this scene with the one which had greeted Jaren when he’d landed
and mused to herself at the reversal of roles.&nbsp; When she reached the top
of the stairs the president reached out his hands and she took it pulled her
towards him and embraced her warmly, which surprised her.&nbsp; Her own people
weren’t particularly averse to physical contact, but from the time she’d been
spending with Jaren she was beginning to understand that his people were just
more physically expressive in general than her own.&nbsp; She hugged the man
back as she came to understand this, and observed as Felix, Elim, and Keri were
all likewise welcomed and embraced by the president’s aides.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The president pulled away and introduced himself as Adam
Mortensen, President of the Kobol Colony, offering his full name and
title.&nbsp; “This is a day that will long be remembered and celebrated by our
people.&nbsp; Our long divided family has finally been made whole again.”&nbsp;
He put his arm around her shoulder and turned her around to face the
crowd.&nbsp; He put his fist in the air and yelled out to the crowd:
“UNITY!!!”&nbsp; The people exploded with cheers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Several hours later Kathryn and her team found themselves at
their formal reception for them at the president’s residence.&nbsp; The
building they had met the president at the foot of, turned out to be the heart
of their central government.&nbsp; At the base, at the top of the stairs, were
the congress and senate where the business of governance took place, with
offices of the members on the upper levels, and the top half dozen levels taken
up by the president’s offices and residence.&nbsp; It was on one of these upper
levels which the Haven team found themselves.&nbsp; This reception area was
ringed with a spacious open air patio, with the narrower upper three level all
taken up by the official residence of the president.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Haven team spent the afternoon being shown to their
official guest accommodations in the presidential residence, and being adorned
with what were fashionable high end clothing for modern Kobol.&nbsp; Kathryn
and Keri found themselves in long elegant dresses altogether familiar from home
with gold jewellery on their ears which attached to the top of their earlobes,
and with many fine strands of gold draping over their ears.&nbsp; Felix and
Elim found themselves swadled in a very luxurious fabric worn as what could
only be described as a toga.&nbsp; They all found the men’s formal wear
somewhat amusing at first, but the amusement quickly gave way to an
appreciation of how comfortable the garments were to wear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Barnes,
Parker, Terey, Reed, I have a couple people here to introduce you to,” Jaren
offered.&nbsp; “This is Francis,” he offered as he introduced a white bearded
man in a black robe and a woman of a similar age on his arm, “and his wife
Teresa, they are the Roman ambassadors to Kobol.&nbsp; They are accompanied by
a full diplomatic staff, but if you have any questions about Roma or the
Catholics,” he put his arm around Francis’ shoulder and his other hand on the
nearer one, “these are the people to ask, alright?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh
yes, wonderful.&nbsp; Thank you Jaren.”&nbsp; Jaren nodded before stopping one
of the residence staff carrying a tray of drinks and took one.&nbsp; He happily
took a drink as he walked away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Sirs?&nbsp;
Madams?&nbsp; May I interest you as well?” the server asked while holding out
the tray.&nbsp; With a nod of permission from Kathryn all four took one of the
fluted glass full of bubbling rose coloured liquid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
is it?” Keri asked as the Roman ambassadors respectfully declined.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It is
a drink fermented from the nectar of the beashou flower which grows wild on
this planet.&nbsp; It is quite a delicacy on this planet and if I do say so
myself quite delicious.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Alcoholic?”
Keri asked with a curious but mild surprise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh
yes,” the server answered.&nbsp; “Roughly nine percent by volume.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Forgive
me, but…” she cautiously asked, “wasn’t abstinence from alcohol and other
substances a rather strict rule for your people?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>A lot
can change in seven hundred years,” the server said with a mischievous smile
before disappearing back into the crowd.&nbsp; Keri looked after him for a
moment in thought as she watched him leave.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>So,
Francis and Teresa, I’m so happy to meet you.&nbsp; We’ve been looking forward
to it every bit as much as the people of Kobol,” Kathryn offered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Likewise
Commander Barnes.&nbsp; We’ve been very anxious to meet you as well.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We are
both fortunate for having been granted the opportunity by the Kobolians,”
Kathryn offered diplomatically</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Indeed,”
Teresa said with some uncertainty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I look
forward to seeing your world, Ambassadors,” Kathryn said with sincerity.&nbsp;
“As exciting as it is to be here, I seem to only find myself hungry for
more.&nbsp; I feel something like a child confronted with infinite
wonder.&nbsp; There is so much to see and learn, it would be intimidating if it
weren’t so exciting.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Indeed,”
Teresa repeated with more satisfaction this time.&nbsp; “Would you join me for
some air on the terrace?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Certainly,”
Kathryn respectfully answered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>My
husband will be happy to entertain your crewmates while we talk,” she said,
indicating that she’d like to speak with her alone.&nbsp; The late middle aged
woman led Kathryn outside and walked out to the edge of the terrace.&nbsp; It
was dark out now, and in front of them was the park where they’d landed in, and
beyond it on all sides were all manner of glass towers with a random pattern of
rooms lighted on all the towers.&nbsp; Lights would occasionally flick on and
off, almost creating the effect of twinkling twilight.&nbsp; Back dropped by
the clear night sky, it was an overwhelming and hypnotic sight to behold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ambassador leaned over the railing and looked all the
way down to the ground before turning her back on the city and facing Kathryn
again.&nbsp; “First of all, it is my duty and pleasure to formally extend to
you and your people an invitation to visit Roma.&nbsp; Whether you’d like to
send an exploratory expedition first or jump right into sending official
dignitaries, we will celebrate the day the first representatives of Haven set
foot on Roma.&nbsp; From what I understand the Escher Rift can open a portal
between our systems as easily as to and from them to Kobol.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Thank
you,” Kathryn respectfully acknowledged.&nbsp; “Any of us would be honoured to
take you up on your invitation and I have no doubt a delegation will be
assembled as soon as I have the opportunity to transmit your invitation back
home.&nbsp; I have every confidence that a similar invitation will immediately
be extended to your people from mine as well.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teresa smiled warmly and only slightly mischievously.&nbsp;
“Well, now that all of the formalities are out of the way, what do you make of
the Kobolians Commander Barnes, one off-worlder to another?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn felt cautious.&nbsp; She felt as though anything she
might say would be kept in confidence, but at the same time she had only just
met this woman and she was representing her world here.&nbsp; “Please, call me
Kathryn.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teresa nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
Kobolians seem generous enough to me, given all they’ve done for us so far.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Ah,”
Teresa acknowledged, “but you have something they need don’t you?&nbsp; That
archive of yours… they consider it one of the most valuable things in the
entire universe isn’t it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s
what they seem to think…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Hmm,
as would we as well.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
can’t personally speak for my government to this of course, but I have no doubt
that my people would be happy to make the archive available to you as
well.&nbsp; It seems to me a legacy to which all of the children of Earth are
entitled to.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
Earth…&nbsp; Tell me, are you any more curious about the mystery of what
happened to Earth as the people of Kolob are?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh
absolutely!” Kathryn exclaimed.&nbsp; “Actually we are quite dumbfounded at
Kobol’s lack of interest in it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Thank
the lord!” Teresa exclaimed.&nbsp; “Although they have only recently made
contact with the Solar Escher facility, we are finding ourselves quite
frustrated at their lack of interest in exploring the mysteries of our home
planet.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Jaren
says his people have little interest because they don’t see the story of Earth
after they left as a meaningful part of their own story.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s
what they tell us as well… sounds somewhat chauvinistic doesn’t it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Perhaps,
but…” Kathryn hesitated, not sure if she should add what came to mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Talking
to Jaren I get the sense that… it’s somehow more about technology to
them.&nbsp; They seem to value it above all else.&nbsp; They made a few passes
of the planet and after doing some survey scanning determined there was nothing
they could use.&nbsp; No technology of interest, no value in any further
investigation for them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What a
waste…” Teresa uttered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>They
can’t be entirely single-minded about it though…&nbsp; If they were the
archives wouldn’t interest them.&nbsp; I find it hard to believe that they
think they’ll find any technological secrets in it, they are now far superior
technologically to those who created it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Perhaps.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>If I
may ask, why hasn’t Roma launched its own expedition?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We are
desperate to, believe me!” she exclaimed.&nbsp; “But… we need the Kobolians’ help
to do so, I’m somewhat embarrassed to admit.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
see.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We are
sufficiently technologically competent to eventually mount such an expedition
on our own, but it would take many years to develop the technology to build a
sufficient vessel with the right tools to mount such an expedition.&nbsp; We
have no space program of our own to speak of.&nbsp; As much as we are
passionately curious about Earth, my people don’t have much of a spirit for
exploration for its own purpose, so our space technology is somewhat rudimentary.&nbsp;
As you’ve seen though, everything we’d need are off the shelf technologies here
on Kobol.&nbsp; We are growing impatient with them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
think they’re deliberately blocking you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No,”
she said with a long heavy sigh, “I think they just don’t care.&nbsp; I think
it’s such a low priority to them, that… our interest in it is an equally low
priority.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That
must be frustrating,” Kathryn observed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Incredibly,”
the ambassador acknowledged with gritted teeth, “but now you’re here aren’t
you?&nbsp; And with that marvelous ship you brought with you…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
are you suggesting?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
really have no right to ask, but… I could offer a suggestion as friends with
mutual interests.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Go
on…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
have a bargaining chip which we don’t have, your precious archive.&nbsp; With
that ship you’re already halfway there.&nbsp; You would only need to request
certain modest upgrades to the New Horizon from the Kobolians to be able to
mount your own expedition to Earth.&nbsp; If they declined for some reason,
Roma could provide you with surface to orbit shuttles and whatever supplies
you’d need, but it would take months to get there and then to Earth under New
Horizon’s existing engines.&nbsp; With a refit using Kobol technology you could
get to Earth in as little as four days.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Wow,
that’s…” she turned around, leaned back against the railing and looked up into
the night sky.&nbsp; “That’s so ambitious,” she said as she looked at her
again.&nbsp; “My mission was only to open relations with you Kolob and Roma
while letting Kolob harvest the data in the archives in exchange for access to
the Escher technology.&nbsp; I never imagined… it never occurred to me that we
could use New Horizon in that way, that we’d be in a position to launch our own
missions using the ship and the Escher rifts.&nbsp; To us New Horizon was
always a… a purpose, a destination unto itself.&nbsp; It never occurred to us
that we could actually you know, use it, as a ship, on a continuing
basis.&nbsp; I mean until a few weeks ago there was nowhere for us to go in it
unless we wanted to leave Haven forever the way our founders left Earth
forever.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
it’s something you’re going to need to think about now.&nbsp; The only ships we
have of our own are glorified surface to orbit shuttles, everything else we
have to rely on the kindness of the Koboli for.&nbsp; We have nothing like on
the scale of the New Horizon.&nbsp; As long as you retain control of it, you
are automatically the second most space capable colony, but your capacity is
incomplete.&nbsp; If necessary we would be happy to provide you with our
shuttles if you can’t obtain any from the Koboli.&nbsp; The engines you have
are enough to slowly make your way between worlds already, but an anti-matter
engine upgrade would make rapid transit quite practical for your people.&nbsp;
If you can play Kolob right in renegotiating access to your archives, you could
get both from them tomorrow.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The woman put her hand on the arm Kathryn was resting on the
bannister.&nbsp; “Think about it,” she urged before heading back into the
party.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn stood there looking back into the party for a
time.&nbsp; It was so bright, and everything with a golden yellow tinge to
it.&nbsp; She wasn’t sure how long she was standing there lost in thought when
she noticed that Irvina approach her through the doors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Nice
night,” she offered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,”
Kathryn agreed, quite mild.”&nbsp; She was always amused when small talk was so
small the weather was actually discussed.&nbsp; “What are the seasons like
here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Quite
mild actually, there’s only an eight percent axial tilt to Kobol, so there
isn’t much change between seasons.&nbsp; Of what we do have we’re in what you’d
call spring right now.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Your
president is an interesting fellow, very…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Superficial?&nbsp;
Glib?&nbsp; Glad-handy?&nbsp; Smarmy?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Tell
me what you really think…” Kathryn chuckled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
don’t particularly care for him… neither does Jaren.&nbsp; He’s too
conservative for our liking, not that we’re wild-eyed liberals or anything.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
understand.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>He
doesn’t support the space fleet’s efforts to open up new worlds, and he’s
repeatedly tried to reduce funding for the effort.”&nbsp; The woman pushed off
the railing and turned around to lean on it instead, bracing herself with her
hands out beside her.&nbsp; “Doesn’t stop him from taking as much credit as he
can for all our successes though.&nbsp; I don’t like that.&nbsp; I don’t like
what that says about him as a person.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Frankly,
it’s refreshing to hear someone talk so… frankly.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Irvina shrugged.&nbsp; “I’m not a diplomat,” she finished
her drink, “just an engineer.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I can
definitely relate,” Kathryn offered, “I’m not exactly in my element here either.”&nbsp;
She smiled, looked down at her dress and pulled the fabric out beside
her.&nbsp; “I honestly can’t remember the last time I wore a dress at all let
alone getting all fancied up like this.&nbsp; I’m a test pilot for god’s sake,”
she laughed.&nbsp; “I’m most comfortable in a flight suit!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Irvina stepped forward and pulled two more glasses off of
the tray of a passing server and handed one to Kathryn who took it.&nbsp; The
two looked into the party and saw Jaren continuing to glad hand and converse
with other party guests.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Not
like him though,” Irvina said with a smirk.&nbsp; “He loves this kind of
thing.&nbsp; Total extrovert that one.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Is
that why it didn’t work with you two?” Kathryn asked without thinking.&nbsp;
Irvina shot a suspicious look at her which then softened.&nbsp; She was seemingly
surprised at Kathryn knowing about her history with Jaren at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No…
no,” the woman answered somewhat distantly as she looked at him.&nbsp; “That
was never a problem.&nbsp; If anything I found that it tended to compliment my
inwardness rather well.&nbsp; Who knows why it doesn’t work out between two
people?” she asked rhetorically.&nbsp; <span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Sometimes
it does… sometimes it doesn’t.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two were quiet for longer than it felt like, both
reflecting on what had been in their respective romantic pasts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>He
does, by the way,” Irvina said with a mischievous smile as she took another sip
of her drink.&nbsp; “If you were wondering.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Does
what?” Kathryn asked, confused.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Like
you as much as you like him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn balked as she smiled and looked down; she could feel
herself starting to blush.&nbsp; Irvina laughed a friendly and playful laugh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Don’t
worry, so far you’re hiding it as well as you should be expected to…” she was
still smiling.&nbsp; “No, there’s no big dark secret you have to worry about
with that one Kathryn, he really is exactly as he seems.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn nodded.&nbsp; “Thanks for the intel Irvina.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class=MsoNormal>Chapter 9</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
president will see you now,” his aide informed her before showing her through
the heavy leather clad door.&nbsp; Kathryn was immediately struck with how
opulent the d&eacute;cor of the room was.&nbsp; Her own president’s official office
was certainly fancy by Haven standards, so she supposed the difference was
emblematic of nothing more than how much more prosperous Kobol was than Haven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She brightened noticeably when she saw Jaren sitting on the
red leather couch perpendicular to the large presidential desk it was in front
of.&nbsp; It appeared quite old and was made of a dark wood, and she had an
immediate like of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Hello
Kathryn, good to see you again,” Jaren offered with a smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Likewise
Jaren, I quite enjoyed the reception party last night.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Glad
to hear it,” President Mortensen acknowledged as he closed the leather folder
he’d been working on at his desk when she’d walked in.&nbsp; “Few occasions
around here are as big a cause for celebration as officially welcoming a
delegation from another colony planet for the first time.”&nbsp; He came around
from behind his desk and sat on one of the two red leather chairs facing the
couch and invited her to sit on the couch beside Jaren.&nbsp; “You are after
all only the second other colony planet we’ve made contact.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Were
you able to communicate with your people this morning?” Jaren asked her.&nbsp;
She’d been ordered to check in daily with Haven and had conducted her first
check in this morning.&nbsp; It had gotten boring quite immediately waiting for
messages to be transmitted back and forth.&nbsp; Even through the rift, it took
more than seventeen minutes for a message to travel from planet to planet,
which could be even further delayed since the rift had to be opened for each
passage of a message.&nbsp; It couldn’t be left open indefinitely for such a
conversation on account of not only the system burning out, but also due to the
dangers associated with depriving a planet like Kobol of that much sun light on
a longer timeline.&nbsp; As a result, occasionally the timing would be off and
a message wouldn’t make it through, resulting in an even longer delay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fortunately not much back and forth was required for her
purposes today.&nbsp; She reported a description of Kobol City, her impressions
of the dignitaries and diplomats she’d met, both the Koboli as well as the
Roman ambassadors.&nbsp; Along with her expected report, she included details
of the conversation she’d had with Ambassador Teresa and requested direction on
how to proceed on the suggestion presented to her.&nbsp; She chose to leave out
Irvina’s opinion of the president on an official channel.&nbsp; She felt that
kind of information could wait to be relayed in person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It took nearly an hour for her original transmission to
receive a response, suggesting that some time had been taken on her home planet
to discuss how to proceed before they replied.&nbsp; It was after all a huge
decision to consider quite quickly.&nbsp; There must have been some impulse to maintain
the New Horizon exactly as it was, as something like a museum ship, or perhaps
something more like a temple.&nbsp; However, when considering how the original
builders of the ship would feel, one would think that they built the ship to be
used, to facilitate travel and adventure.&nbsp; In this light it seemed like
such a shame to just mothball it, to render it merely inert and forbid it any
further use.&nbsp; It was a tool which begged to be used, not put away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
we were able to communicate quite effectively through the rift.&nbsp; I greatly
appreciate the permission to use your equipment to do so.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Our
pleasure.&nbsp; So what’s your next move?&nbsp; We’d be happy to facilitate
setting up a formal embassy for Haven here on Kobol, and as soon as possible
we’d like to formally request the opportunity to set up a similar facility for
ourselves on Haven.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Thank
you.&nbsp; I will forward those sentiments in my transmission tomorrow.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How is
your team finding their time here?” Mortensen asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh,
like children in a candy store!” she exclaimed.&nbsp; “They’re still spending
time with the crew Jaren brought to Haven.&nbsp; We all got to know each other
along the way,” she smiled at Jaren, “and they’re still trying to learn
everything they can about your world, your history, your art, science,
technology… they couldn’t be more excited.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Glad
to hear it.&nbsp; Irvina, Xion, and Nadelle seem to be quite fond of your
people as well.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>So…
how long will it take for you to copy the archive?” Kathryn leadingly asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Over a
year,” Jaren sighed with obvious lament.&nbsp; “It takes a long time to read
that much data on the New Horizon’s decoder and transmit it down to the surface
one page at a time”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well…
I have been authorized to make you an offer which should speed up the process
considerably,” Kathryn suggested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We…
are eager to hear your suggestion,” the president offered with uncertainty as
he looked over at Jaren momentarily.&nbsp; “Go ahead.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
I understand that an investigative expedition to Earth is low on your people’s
list of priorities for whatever reason,” Kathryn cautiously started, “but for
my people it has always been a priority second only to reaching the New Horizon
itself.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
thought you’d get along with the Romans,” Jaren said with a knowing smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
are you proposing?” President Mortensen asked, much more seriously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
you’re right Jaren, in speaking with Ambassador Teresa, we concluded that if
the New Horizon were properly supplied, it is a quite appropriate ship for an
expedition mission of that kind.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mortensen shot a concerned look at Jaren, but he seemed only
intrigued with a single raised eyebrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Don’t
worry,” Kathryn tried to reassure them, “we have every intention of honouring
the deal we’ve already made with you.”&nbsp; The president seemed to relax
somewhat, but Jaren remained merely intrigued as to what she wanted to
propose.&nbsp; “However, I have been authorized by my people’s government to
negotiate an arrangement further to our additional one which we believe would
serve us both quite well.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
I’m happy to hear what you have to offer,” Mortensen said with a smile, a smile
which Kathryn could now recognize how fake it was after speaking with Irvina
about him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>So, we
agreed that in exchange for you helping us get the New Horizon up and running
again, and granting us access to your Escher rift system, we are allowing you
to copy the contents of the archives.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>President Mortensen nodded and rolled his wrist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>As you
know though, part of that original arrangement was that we retain possession
and control of the archive.&nbsp; That’s why you’re having to go through the
painstaking process of reading it sheet by sheet on the ship and then
transmitting it down to the surface.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s
right,” Mortensen acknowledged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>But
like you said it’ll take you a long time to do it this way.&nbsp; Well I’ve
been authorized to offer you the opportunity to physically remove the archive
from the New Horizon in order to be able to copy it here on the surface much
faster than the methods you’re limited to now using the ship’s native built in
technology.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The president looked at Jaren with cautious
inquisitiveness.&nbsp; “It’s too precious to risk atmospheric entry with it,”
Jaren suggested, “but we could certainly launch appropriate equipment into
orbit to read it much quicker up there.&nbsp; If you were to let us do this, we
could have the entire contents transferred in only couple weeks!”&nbsp; Jaren
seemed quite excited at the prospect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>And
what would you want in return?” President Mortensen seemed far more concerned
with her ask than with what she was offering in return.&nbsp; The archive and
its contents clearly didn’t mean much to him beyond what it could benefit him
politically.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
first of all we’d want the archive back when you were done with it of course.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Of
course.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>As
well as a complete copy of its contents.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>As we
originally agreed, yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>In
exchange for this concession on our part, we would ask for an upgrading re-fit
of the New Horizon.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Upgragde?”
Jaren asked with another raise of his eyebrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
kind of re-fit?” the president asked dubiously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The kind
which would allow us to mount our own investigative expedition to Earth.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The president leaned back in the chair, laced his fingers
behind his head, and looked up towards the ceiling.&nbsp; She could tell it
seemed like a big ask to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Jaren
helped us re-start the fusion core so we’ve got plenty of power, and the
atmospheric cycler you’ve already provided us takes care of the ship’s
environmental needs.&nbsp; But, we are still limited in propulsion with its
original ion engines.&nbsp; If you could replace them with some of your fancy
anti-matter engines as well as an adequate supply of fuel, we could cut our
transit time between planets from months down to days.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mortensen looked over at Jaren.&nbsp; “Is that even
possible?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren pursed his lips as he considered what would be
involved.&nbsp; “Probably… yes, sure.&nbsp; But it would take some doing.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We…
would also require a couple shuttles with orbital ascent and descent
capability.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mortensen eyes narrowed slightly.&nbsp; She had the sense
that he was deciding that he didn’t like her.&nbsp; “Is that all?” he asked
with a sarcasm that seemed poorly masked by design.&nbsp; “It’s a big ask,
Commander Barnes.&nbsp; We do well for ourselves, but our resources are far
from infinite.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
appreciate that, but… well, can I be honest with you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
would hope you have already been,” Mortensen countered expressionlessly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Er,”
Kathryn’s face scrunched at the realization of her unforced error.&nbsp; “If
you’ll allow me to rephrase, what I mean is that what I’m about to say I
haven’t been officially authorized to say, and is only of my own mind.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The president nodded his understanding. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
Romans are as motivated as we are to investigate Earth, and have offered
whatever resources they have which could help us, and we could technically pull
this off ourselves.&nbsp; They have adequate shuttles and the New Horizon’s
original engines could eventually get us all the way to Roma and then all the
way to Earth.&nbsp; Like I said earlier though, it would take years.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>And
you’d have to wait until we harvested the archive to even start, unless you
intend to…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn put up her hand to stop him.&nbsp; “That’s the other
thing, again in my own mind if this is the only option we’re left with, I’m
convinced my government wouldn’t want to wait, nor would they want to cross
Kobol.&nbsp; I have to imagine they’d let you take the archive off of the New
Horizon either way.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Why
are you telling us this?” Mortensen asked bluntly.&nbsp; “It’s not a very
effective negotiation strategy.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Because
I want to impress on you just how important Earth is to Haven and Roma.&nbsp;
We’ll do it on our own if we have to, even if it means giving up our only
bargaining chip to do so, it’s that important.&nbsp; I don’t…” she sighed, “I
still don’t fully understand your people’s lack of interest, but that your
prerogative and that’s fine.&nbsp; But I sense that your people have a real
desire to be friends with mine, as we do with you.&nbsp; I ask you not only to
share in what we discover, but as a gesture of friendship.&nbsp; To do this for
us would cement our appreciation of your people as our strong friends and
allies unambiguously.”&nbsp; She sat forward on the couch and physically leaned
in to her argument.&nbsp; “Granting us this, would make us a space-faring
people as long as we have the New Horizon, and this could be useful to you as
well.&nbsp; When we’re done with Earth we would be an additional ship you could
call on to assist in whatever ventures you do with to engage in, or to respond
to your own ships in distress; you would create a resource of our sincere
friendship, which would additionally grant you the resource of access to an
upgraded New Horizon for whatever mutual interests we have, and-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Okay,
okay!” the president said with a laugh as he held up his hands.&nbsp; “You’ve
convinced me!&nbsp; Make it happen Jaren, with all responsible haste.&nbsp;
Kathryn you’re right. &nbsp;We aren’t interested in Earth.&nbsp; We consider it
a place we may someday want to establish a new colony there, but who may be
there now, or… what made it lose all technological sophistication, it really
doesn’t matter to us.&nbsp; There’s nothing of value there now.&nbsp; But, as a
people we do place a sacred value in family.&nbsp; Your colony is sibling to
ours, and we would go to lengths which may even surprise you to secure and
nurture friendship between our peoples.&nbsp; From our perspective you are our
siblings, but whatever is left on Earth is a pale shadow of our noble parent
civilization which used to exist there.&nbsp; To us what has happened to Earth
is just a shame best… left honoured to rest.&nbsp; We mourn Earth more than we
are curious about it, but clearly that’s just us.&nbsp; Commander Barnes, there
was no need to negotiate.&nbsp; You only needed to make it clear how important
your request was to us, and what it would mean as a gesture of good will.&nbsp;
We will breathe new life into your precious ship and honour its builders.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How
long will it take?” Mortensen asked Jaren.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Only a
few days if we make haste.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Grand,”
President Mortensen said as he stood and headed back behind his desk.&nbsp;
“Okay, Jaren you oversee the refit, Barnes please report to Haven our agreement
and our request for formal embassy staff to be brought here especially if you
and yours will be gone in a few days.&nbsp; Since the Romans seem as obsessed
with Earth as you seem to be, you might want to ask them if they’d like to send
some people along with you if you’d welcome them.&nbsp; Just a thought.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
thank you sir, I doubt we’d be able to keep them away.&nbsp; And personally
sir… thank you very much.&nbsp; A month ago I thought setting foot on the New
Horizon would be the height of my career and the biggest moment of my
life.&nbsp; Now… it seems that it was only the beginning.&nbsp; I have your
people to thank for that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Putting
our family back together is our pleasure,” he answered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
can’t believe we’re actually going to get to go, it’s… like a dream,” Felix
said as he and Kathryn laid on the ground that night looking up at the night
sky.&nbsp; They were in the back yard of a government guest residence facility
a bit of a ways out of town.&nbsp; The next morning her and her team would be
ascending to re-board the New Horizon and oversee the re-fits and get a crash
course in all of the new technology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After her meeting with the president Kathryn had
communicated with her home world again and been profusely praised and
congratulated for good work.&nbsp; She’d been told that when this phase of her
career was over she had a promising future as an ambassador if she wanted
it.&nbsp; She wasn’t sure how she felt about that prospect.&nbsp; For now she
was just happy that she could enjoy the role which the fates had landed her in
presently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
like a dream…” she answered distantly.&nbsp; The sky was different.&nbsp; It
was funny, she’d never really studied the Haven sky much; she’d never really
appreciated the pattern to it.&nbsp; But seeing a totally alien sky, how
different it was made her appreciate how familiar she must have been with the
sky she’d grown up under, even without ever thinking much about it.&nbsp; The
moon was bright, and this was the most striking thing.&nbsp; There was no
comparable large moon on Haven, just a few small captured asteroids on a slow
march to inevitable destruction.&nbsp; The moon was nearly full and provided a
remarkable amount of light reflected from the sun, more than she’d ever have
imagined such an effect could produce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>He’s
pretty dreamy too, isn’t he?” Felix asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yeah…”
Kathryn answered, immediately thinking about Jaren when he’d said it.&nbsp; She
then snapped to her senses.&nbsp; “Wait, what?&nbsp; What are you talking
about?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Felix laughed mischievously.&nbsp; “Come on Kat, I know you
better than you know yourself sometimes.&nbsp; I’ve seen the way you two
flirt.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Flirt??”
she cried indignantly with an undercurrent of embarrassment.&nbsp; “I don’t, I
don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Nooo,
of course you don’t,” Felix teased.&nbsp; “I’m jealous… he’s quite a man, and
for whatever reason you’re the only one who seems to have struck anyone’s fancy
on this trip.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Felix
this isn’t a… a cosmic dating cruise,” she expressed in frustration.&nbsp; “I’m
a professional.&nbsp; Even if, if I had… well, it’d be… aw fuck it.” she sighed
as she looked up into the night sky.&nbsp; “Is it really that obvious?” she
asked.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Just
to those who care about you,” he answered.&nbsp; “You’re not with Tobyn
anymore, you’re free to do whatever you want.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
didn’t want to entertain anything while we were still on the mission to get
here, but we’re still here on official function though aren’t we?&nbsp;
Wouldn’t it still be professionally inappropriate to… to date a Koboli at this
point?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m
clearly the wrong person to ask, I don’t think the mission we were on should
have even stopped you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You’re
encourageable.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
know.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She couldn’t see him in the dark, but she could tell he was
grinning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>There’d
really nothing stopping you now is there?” he asked.&nbsp; “Unless it has
nothing to do with your work and that’s just an excuse.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
do you mean?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
were with Tobyn forever.&nbsp; It would only be natural if you were scared to
open yourself up to someone else so soon.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Scared?&nbsp;
I don’t know…&nbsp; We spent a lot of time together on the trip here.&nbsp; I
think I really like him… he’s not like anyone I’ve ever met before.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Literally,”
Felix laughed.&nbsp; “He is an alien after all!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn’s brow wrinkled.&nbsp; “Do we call them
aliens?&nbsp; I mean if they’re from another world but they’re still humans…
are they really aliens?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
know?&nbsp; I don’t know… I guess it’s up to us if we consider them aliens or
not,” Felix answered with as much of a shrug as laying down on the grass
allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two lay on the grass side by side for a while.&nbsp;
Kathryn was surprised again at how much Jaren occupied her thoughts when there
was so much else to think about, so many things which her professional brain
considered so important and exciting, and yet…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Pretty
dreamy indeed…” Felix teased, breaking the silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn punched his arm hard but he just laughed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As his laughter turned to pouting and he rubbing the now
tender spot where she’d punched him, Jaren appeared at their feet looking down
at them.&nbsp; “There you are,” he said.&nbsp; “Commander, there’s something
I’d like to discuss with you about the mission.&nbsp; Care to walk with me?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Romantic
nighttime stroll under the stars you say?” Felix mischievously asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Felix!!”
Kathryn hissed at him with a mixture of fury and embarrassment in her eyes,
before punching him again in the same spot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>OW!!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m…
I’m sorry?” Jaren asked, confused.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Forget
it,” Kathryn quickly said as she took his arm and led him away.&nbsp; She felt
fortunate that the darkness of the night obscured her blushing, at least she
hoped it did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before she could get away, Felix grabbed her arm to stop
her.&nbsp; He leaned in and kissed her on the cheek.&nbsp; Before pulling back
he whispered in her ear: “I’m sorry Kat, I just want you to be happy.”&nbsp; He
smirked at Jaren before turning to head back into the residence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Um,
shall we?” Jaren asked awkwardly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
of course.” Kathryn answered.&nbsp; She held out her hand for him to lead and
then followed beside him.&nbsp; “So what did you want to talk about?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
while my people are rather dismissive of Earth, people like myself and my team
don’t necessarily share that lack of enthusiasm.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
we’re the type who volunteer for missions like first contact with Haven.&nbsp;
We’re into that sort of thing, even if the wide majority of our people are
not.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
are you saying?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We’d
like to come with you.&nbsp; Me, Irvina, Xion… Nadelle.&nbsp; We’re all onboard
if you’ll have us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Really?&nbsp;
Well that’s fantastic!&nbsp; Of course we’d be happy to have you along.&nbsp; A
four person team from each planet is exactly what we need and it would be a big
help to have you along in case anything goes wrong with any of your technology.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren nodded.&nbsp; “My thoughts exactly.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Wait,
you don’t want to come along just to make sure I’m okay do you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What?&nbsp;
No, that’s… no.&nbsp; Well, I think the mission has a better chance of safe
success with us along if that’s what you mean.&nbsp; Plus we’d certainly all
feel terrible if you got into trouble trying to use our technology and didn’t
have anyone there to help you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
see…&nbsp; Well I’m glad to know you have more interest than the rest of your
people.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You’ve
had a lot to do with it Kathryn.&nbsp; Your people were an inspiration to my
team.”&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two were walking through a forested area which now
opened onto a meadow beside a modest lake which reflected the moonlight in a
wide streak across the surface of the water.&nbsp; Kathryn bit her lip and
silently damned Felix for putting the idea of a romantic walk into her
head.&nbsp; This locale certainly fit the bill and it now made her
uncomfortable for some reason.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Have
you asked the Romans about it?” he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Absolutely.&nbsp;
As I mentioned it was their idea in the first place,” she answered.&nbsp; “They
were quite eager to participate when I told them your President agreed.&nbsp;
By the way I see where she’s coming from but Mortensen didn’t seem nearly as
objectionable as Irvina made him out to be.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>If you
ever question or challenge him you’ll see what she means.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Right.&nbsp;
Anyways, the Roman ambassadors insisted on joining the mission themselves along
with two of their embassy staff.&nbsp; They said that their home world would
immediately dispatch temporary replacement ambassadors to Kobol.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Three
teams of four working together, there’s a certain… symmetry to it isn’t there?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes.&nbsp;
I think it will work out well.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
about your own people?&nbsp; Have they agreed to exchange embassies?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes
actually, my people agreed quite eagerly.&nbsp; Your people will send their
mission to Haven on a transport ship which will then return Haven’s mission
here.&nbsp; It’s all coming along so well and so fast, it’s incredible!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She found herself stealing glances at him, trying to appear
as though she were casually looking at other things about them.&nbsp; When she
realized what she was doing she privately chastised herself and insisted she
stop.&nbsp; Immediately after she did it again despite herself but this time
caught him doing the same thing and they both understood the glances the other
had failed to adequately mask.&nbsp; They both looked away from each other
embarrassed.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren turned back to her to say: “Look, Commander, I-”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That was all he could get out before she grabbed him with
her left arm around his waist and her right hand on the side of his face as she
kissed him.&nbsp; They paused with their lips on each other, but it felt so
right they couldn’t resist opening their mouths and kissing more deeply ever so
briefly before they both pulled away despite their desire to continue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Kat,”
she croaked as she looked away at the lake and fought back a tear.&nbsp; “Call
me Kat,” she said.&nbsp; “At least, when we’re alone… you can call me Kat.” &nbsp;She
was trembling.&nbsp; She had no idea what she was doing, what she’d just done,
or if it had been a terrible mistake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Command-”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Kat.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Okay,
okay,” he smiled.&nbsp; “Kat.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I know
what you’re going to say Jaren, and I agree.&nbsp; That was stupid.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He touched her chin and directed her gaze back towards
him.&nbsp; “That is not what I was going to say.&nbsp; I was going to say, I
was wondering how long we’d be able to resist before one of did that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh,
so…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I feel
like we became very close on the trip here,”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I feel
the same way…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Clearly,”
he said with a grin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
don’t know if it’s… appropriate though.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Appropriate?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We’re…
colleagues.&nbsp; Shouldn’t we be trying to keep things… professional?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
believe we have been trying.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn looked down and smiled.&nbsp; “Jaren tonight I don’t
see anything wrong with… this,” she said as she gestured back and forth between
them.&nbsp; “But if you come on this mission with us… we become colleagues
again.&nbsp; It becomes inappropriate again doesn’t it?<span lang=JA
style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
wouldn’t want to do anything which would make you feel uncomfortable Kat.&nbsp;
I understand your concerns about intermingling the personal with the
professional, but for the record, I am bound by no rules which forbid… this.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Now
that I think about it neither do it,” she reflected with surprise.&nbsp; “But
it still would seem implied.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Fair
enough,” he somberly agreed.&nbsp; He held his hand out for her to shake.&nbsp;
“So, just colleagues then?&nbsp; As long as we’re working together?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She shook his hand, but held it.&nbsp; Keeping hold of his
hand she slowly twirled herself around, putting her back to his chest and
holding his hand to her breast.&nbsp;&nbsp; “On the other hand… we can be
discrete right?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Discrete…
right.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class=MsoNormal>Chapter 10</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Jaren predicted, it took the better part of three days to
retrofit the New Horizon.&nbsp; Given the ship’s status as an historical
artifact as well as a starship, an orbital storage facility was converted to
house the components of New Horizon which would need to be removed in order to
be replaced.&nbsp; The pieces belonged to Haven and when they decided what to
do with them the pieces would be there for them to retrieve.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The large ion drives had to be removed first in order to be
replaced with the Koboli anti-matter engines.&nbsp; Not much integration
between the systems was required.&nbsp; Quite a few of the now empty round
hydrogen and xenon storage tanks immediately aft of the engines were removed to
make room for the anti-matter storage tanks required to supply the
engine.&nbsp; Since they were self-contained units, the most challenging part
to accomplish so quickly was programming the module which would translate the
computer interface between the entirely different programming languages used in
the different world’s technologies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But, with a tremendous effort, the upgrades were now
complete, and the physical archives were transferred to an orbital outpost
where several dozen automated reading machines could be used instead of just
the three manual readers the New Horizon was equipped with onboard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With the three teams of four found themselves splitting into
four specialist teams quite organically.&nbsp; Jaren and Kathryn teamed up with
Teresa in a command and oversight role, while Felix and Irvina teamed up with
Francis who turned out to also be an engineer.&nbsp; Deirdre, the humanities
specialist they’d brought along with them teamed up with Keri and Xion.&nbsp;
Deirdre turned out to be Teresa and Francis’ daughter, and so far all three
seemed to be getting along quite well, and would spend hours on end comparing
notes on the differences between their respective cultures.&nbsp; Something
magical happened when people of similar interests and research backgrounds got
together, especially with humanities experts, where by virtue of being part of
different cultures, each was both a teacher and a subject of study to the
others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anastasius, who preferred to be called Ana, was the personal
physician assigned to the ambassadors, and had been as eager as any Roman to be
a part of the expedition which was finally being sent to investigate the Earth
mystery.&nbsp; Like Elim and Nadelle, he also had a background in biology with
a specialty in genetics in addition to being a medical doctor.&nbsp; The three
of them also seemed to be getting along quite well, if not as eagerly engaging
with each other as Keri, Xion, and Deirdre so enthusiastically were.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The morning of the launch, Kathryn was consulting with
Teresa in the captain’s office when Jaren arrived to speak to her as
well.&nbsp; The office was rather unremarkable for a commanding officer’s, not
opulent or status conscious as may have been the case in other fleets.&nbsp; It
was just an office, with a 2 meter wide glass window in the floor through which
the planet occasionally passed through the field of view as the habitat ring
rotated.&nbsp; Window views were at a high premium on the ship given that they
could only exist on the exterior of the habitat ring, and if the office
betrayed any status over any other, it was this privileged view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Commander
Barnes?” Jaren asked as he knocked on the open door frame.&nbsp; “Or should I
say Captain?&nbsp; I hear you got a promotion?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yeah,
well can’t have a lowly commander heading the only ship in the fleet,” she
observed with playful dryness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
certainly seem to have earned it,” Teresa offered.&nbsp; Kathryn only
respectfully nodded in acknowledgement of the compliment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What’s
up Jaren?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We’re
all done,” he informed her.&nbsp; “We’re doing final checks on everything, but
barring any problems turning up, we’re good to go.”&nbsp; He entered the office
and sat himself at the second chair in front of the desk beside Teresa.&nbsp;
“You’ve got yourself quite a ship here now haven’t you?&nbsp; If you’re only
going to have one, this is certainly a good one to have.&nbsp; Your people are
now free to travel rather quickly to any planet where we’ve set up an Escher
Rift.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Hard
to imagine that a month ago just getting to orbit seemed like a nearly
impossible feat.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
your people are ambitious.&nbsp; I’m sure before long you’ll have a whole fleet
of starships.&nbsp; You’ve got a lot of learning to do but I have absolute
faith in… your people.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Thank
you.&nbsp; I was just telling the ambassador here that I’ve been in contact
with Haven and preparations are being made to send a diplomatic mission to both
Kobol and Roma.&nbsp; As soon as Kobol can spare an appropriate ship, we can
begin the process.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
if we weren’t heading off on this wild gargan chase you could use New Horizon
to ferry people around.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
know, we- wild gargan?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh,
somewhat sizeable flight less bird around these parts.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Mmmkay,
well in any case you’re right.&nbsp; In fact, Haven is desperate to get New
Horizon back to Haven after our current mission.&nbsp; With the shuttles you’ve
provided us there are so many people who are incredibly anxious to come up and
see this ship for themselves; there’s still so much to learn about it.&nbsp;
And now with the re-fit, there’s even talk of formally recommissioning
it.&nbsp; But, the anxiousness to do all of that remains eclipsed by our need
to find out what happened to Earth.&nbsp; Everyone seems in agreement that all
that can wait against the weight of our current mandate.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It’s
too bad Roma still hasn’t developed or accepted any appropriate ships.&nbsp; If
they had you could exchange embassies without our help.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teresa looked insulted but remained diplomatic.&nbsp; “Not
everyone is as comfortable being as reckless with developing their technology
as your people can be Jaren.&nbsp; Kathryn,” she said turning to the now
Captain Barnes, “my people certainly were offered Kobol technology as freely as
your people were, but we declined and I recommend you do as well.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh?”
Kathryn inquired with all due concern.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh it all
works fine I’m sure, but it is dangerous to rely on technology you do not
understand.&nbsp; My people value the process of methodical inquiry
itself.&nbsp; We appreciate being pointed in the right direction, but prefer to
discover and develop things for ourselves, so that we understand what we build
and use as well as anyone.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn nodded her understanding but Teresa seemed to feel
the need to continue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
your ship is now equipped with anti-matter engines, but you’ve already admitted
you don’t even know what anti-matter is.&nbsp; What if the systems break down
and stop working?&nbsp; What if they break down that they put the ship at risk
and you can’t even tell?&nbsp; Do you know that if the magnetic containment
bottle the anti-matter fuel is kept in fails for even a fleeting moment this
ship will instantaneously vanish in a titanic explosion?&nbsp; Yes on this trip
Jaren and his people have been kind enough to come along and assist in case of
any trouble, but they can’t assign people to assist you on a permanent basis, and
even if they could and would, you can never be fully independent now that you
use their technology.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
to be fair,” Kathryn observed, “we didn’t understand how New Horizon worked
before at all before it was upgraded.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teresa laughed out loud.&nbsp; “Fair point my dear, fair
point.&nbsp; I only meant to convey that my people place as much value in the
process of development as they do in the result, in the accomplishment of
discovery as much as what a discovery allows.&nbsp; My people are
patient.&nbsp; As long as Jaren’s people are willing to offer transport when
they are able to we are happy to accept their generosity, but we will also not
complain when our schedules and interests do not align.&nbsp; This is why we
were so delighted to discover that your interests in Earth were as serious as
ours.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We are
not immune to your sensibilities Ambassador,” Jaren pointed out.&nbsp; “In fact
if you’ll recall it was our attempt to understand your reluctance to accept
what you offered, that led us to wait to make contact with Haven, to allow them
the opportunity to rediscover New Horizon on their own without us.&nbsp; Once
we had the opportunity to make contact we were desperate to, but you taught us
what we might be robbing them of if we gave them so easily what they’d been
working so long and hard to achieve on their own.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I am
pleased to have had any role I might have in that decision.&nbsp; It was the
right one.” Teresa said with certainty in her position.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
do you think Captain Barnes?” Jaren said with smile when he got to call her
captain for the first time, “were we right to wait?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>In
retrospect… yes.&nbsp; I believe you were.&nbsp; If you’d made contact earlier
it wouldn’t have seemed like we’d been deprived of anything right away, but in
time… I do believe in retrospect we would have had that sense, yes.&nbsp;
However Ambassador, while my people will indeed want to thoroughly understand
whatever technology we routinely employ, I don’t think we will place the same
premium on discovering the science behind that technology for ourselves.&nbsp;
We collectively have from the beginning had a sense of… trying to regain a
technological competency we once had.&nbsp; Even if Kobol technology far
surpasses New Horizon’s original level of technology, I believe we will want to
catch up as quickly as possible.&nbsp; It’ll be important to us to understand
the technology so we can use it safely and responsibly in transforming our
society, but if it’s out there… just on offer and waiting for us… no,” she
shook her head, “no way in hell we’d be able to resist.&nbsp; We have an
ambitious and adventurous spirit.&nbsp; I understand and completely respect
your point of view Ambassador, but I doubt we’ll share it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>In
that vein Jaren, Haven has asked me to clarify that it is acceptable to send
some of our best and brightest scientists to learn about your technology so
they can teach others back on Haven.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It is
more than acceptable Kat- Comman- Captain, if fact after our experience with
Roma it would be a relief,” he uttered.&nbsp; He then realized his offence and
put his hand on Teresa’s shoulder.&nbsp; “I apologize Ambassador, that didn’t
come out the way I’d intended.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
suspect it did,” she surmised with a sigh, “but regardless, I’m pleased for
your people that you now seem to have the playmate you’ve always hoped for.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren accepted the jab without comment, considering it fair
retribution for his own inadvertent attack.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The
ambassador is certainly correct that none of my people adequately understand
the workings of this ship yet.&nbsp; While I will be in command of this mission
overall, I would like you to consider yourself in command of the operations of
the ship, my… executive officer of sorts.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Understood
Captain.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Other
than this I don’t consider any official ranking to be necessary between any of
us.&nbsp; My own people have ranks in our own service of course, but our three
teams I consider to be collaborating equally.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Very
well,” Teresa agreed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Understood,”
Jaren acknowledged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Although…
you know, on its original voyage there was a tradition on this ship, of having
a captain, a matriarch, and a patriarch as the top command structure of the
ship.&nbsp; We are three teams coming together, each with a leader, it only
seems appropriate.&nbsp; I the captain, Jaren the patriarch, and ambassador if
you’ll accept the honorary title you shall be the matriarch.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
did the titles mean?” Teresa asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
captain is pretty self-evident,” Kathryn suggested, “but the others I haven’t
any idea, perhaps just elected father and mother figures.&nbsp; I think it had
a nice sense to it.&nbsp; For our purposes though it’ll just denote we three
the leaders of our own teams but working collaboratively.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Works
for me,” Jaren offered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
agree as well,” Teresa added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The departed with surprisingly little fanfare.&nbsp; Kathryn
received an obligatory communication with President Mortensen wishing her a
safe and prosperous journey, and she likewise received a recorded message from
President Kim back home reminding her of what a grave responsibility she had
been burdened with, but with an expression of her confidence that she was up to
the job.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She sat on the central captain’s chair in the centre of the
bridge and listened while her crew called out ready status on all of the
relevant systems.&nbsp; In addition to the engines and environmental upgrades,
the Koboli had also provided them with a year’s worth of food including fresh
food which would spoil relatively soon if not eaten, food which would last a
couple weeks, as well as long term emergency rations which would remain edible
for hundreds of years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She felt the weight of the moment as her crew finished
calling out ready status, and when they’d finished the bridge crew turned in
their chairs to look at her expectantly.&nbsp; She gave the order and they all
looked about them a little nervously as the ship pointed itself in the correct
orientation to expand its orbit around the planet, and brought the engines up to
full power.&nbsp; They accelerated remarkably quickly and got further and
further away from Kobol until on the final pass they pointed the ship in the
opposite direction of the planet’s orbit around the sun.&nbsp; They gradually
slowed in their orbit around the star and fell ever faster in towards the
gravity well of the sun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once on course Kathryn ordered the shift rotation for the
twenty hours it would take to reach the star as she marvelled at the power of
their new engines.&nbsp; She assigned three shifts and encouraged everyone to
try to get a good sleep in before they reached the rift.&nbsp; She took the
first watch, and then after seven hours in the captain’s chair was relieved by
Teresa.&nbsp; She headed to her quarters, got undressed, and laid naked on her
bed staring at the ceiling.&nbsp; She’d never been comfortable wearing anything
while sleeping, but now it seemed even the comfort of her nudity would be
insufficient to whisk her away to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was just too much on her mind, too much
anticipation.&nbsp; She grew increasingly frustrated, knowing that she’d have
to pay later for her inability to sleep now.&nbsp; Her body betrayed not a hint
of fatigue though, only the sharp awareness of a constant low level of
adrenaline.&nbsp; She found her thoughts cycling between Jaren, Earth, her new
rank, Jaren, Kobol, Roma, Jaren…&nbsp; ‘Dammit,’ she chastised herself.&nbsp;
‘You’ve gotta do better than that,’ she insisted of herself, ‘for both our
sakes.’&nbsp; She kept thinking about the other night with Jaren, how she
wished he’d never had to leave her bed in that residence, how unlike her
experience with him that night had been than with any other (admittedly few)
men she’d been with before, and how much she was growing to resent their need
for subtlety now.&nbsp; The feeling of his skin against hers was unlike any
she’d ever known and she craved to return to that moment again.&nbsp; Being
with him now and pretending they were just colleagues and close friends was
agonizing.&nbsp; Every other thought when she was with him was how much she
wanted to take him to bed again.&nbsp; She wished they could just get on with
it and be together if not just share a suite on the ship.&nbsp; Being partners
in command now though… such behaviour was as inappropriate now as a result as
ever.&nbsp; She was beginning to wonder if she’d made a terrible miscalculation.&nbsp;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With her thoughts racing about Jaren and the mission, it
seemed inconceivable that she’d be able to sleep, but after several hours of
staring at the ceiling, she surprised herself by being able to fall asleep for
at least a few hours, and later on that day she was appreciative for at least
that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They passed through the rift without incident, and the Roman
and Havenite crew felt an odd and unexpected feeling as they exited the rift
into the Solar System.&nbsp; For all of them, there was a sense of reverence, as
though they had just stepped into a graveyard.&nbsp; This was the place of
their ancestors, it was Mount Olympus, home of the gods.&nbsp; It was the
birthplace of all that they were and had become.&nbsp; And now it would take
them nearly three full days to scale the mountain and reach the home of their
species.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To Jaren and his crew it was nothing special, just another
jump into another unremarkable system.&nbsp; But to the rest it was a place of
myth and mystery, a place they’d been working for hundreds of years to find their
way back to, to answer the greatest mystery of all time.&nbsp; Why did Earth go
dark so many years ago?&nbsp; What catastrophe, what force could have made them
abruptly stop transmitting out of the blue one day, with no warning or
explanation whatsoever.&nbsp; Well now they would have the chance to find out,
finally, after half a millennium of waiting.&nbsp; If Kathryn thought she’d had
trouble sleeping before, it was nothing compared to the anxiety she felt now
being on the other side of the rift.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They had figured out how to use some of the original New
Horizon devices they’d found left on the ship.&nbsp; The most useful were the
items the ship’s computers informed her were called ‘scrolls’, devices which
seemed to come in three different sizes.&nbsp; They were portable information
interfaces with the ship consisting of two narrow posts which one pulled apart
to reveal a flexible double sided screen.&nbsp; It could be pulled apart to
whatever the desired length, and anything stored in the archives could be
displayed on it as well as control systems and maps for the ship.&nbsp; Of
course there had only been time to load the basic operations programs into the
ship’s computers so there wasn’t much for the scrolls to access, but it was
convenient to at least be able to easily interface with the ship’s
systems.&nbsp; It appeared that they were primarily designed to be operated by
thought control, but they were quickly figuring out how to use them with touch
controls on the screen, which went rigid after the scroll was pulled apart to
the desired size of screen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She’d heard that the original crew had had devices implanted
in their heads which allowed them to operate the technology by thought control,
but that was one of the first technologies her people had lost the ability to
use.&nbsp; They certainly couldn’t make new implants for themselves, nor did
they have the ability to extract them from their dead and re-implant them in
others.&nbsp; Besides, it wasn’t long after that, that any technology they
could have operated by thought control stopped functioning anyways.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She’d never thought much about the ancient technology the
original settlers were alleged to have.&nbsp; She often wondered how much was
historical record and how much was mythic magic.&nbsp; It was a chaotic time in
those early years, and reliable records were hard to come by.&nbsp; Thought
control had always struck her as something much more likely to be myth than
reality, but here in her hand was the evidence that it was a real technology
that existed and was widely used.&nbsp; It blew her mind to imagine what it
would be like to be able to talk to technology in that way; she just couldn’t
imagine.&nbsp; She had a moment of pride looking forward to the scholars of her
world being able to analyze this ship and finally have the chance to
definitively discriminate the fact from fiction of those early days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In her playing around with her scroll in the long hours of
waiting, she’d figured out how to access the onboard telescopes which she
hadn’t even know had been a part of the original design.&nbsp; When she’d
activated them they emerged from the structure of the central engineering
section and began feeding data to her scroll.&nbsp; The user interface was
remarkably user friendly, and while she’d discovered that the system was
designed in such a way that the four telescopes could somehow work together to
render a sharper image than any one could individually.&nbsp; For this to work
tough, the ship had to be pointed at the target so all four telescopes were in
a square face on to the target.&nbsp; While the ship was under power, it had to
remain pointed at Earth or away from it when it was time to slow down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, while she could only look at Mercury and Venus with
individual telescopes (as she had spent many hours doing so), the
multi-telescope ‘interferometry’ mode which she really didn’t understand could
indeed work for looking at Earth, and she was thrilled and humbled at the
incredible degree of detail this view of the world provided.&nbsp; She’d clued
in the others to the feed and between the entire crew an innumerable number of
hours had been spent by all staring at the live feed and wondering.&nbsp;
They’d found a conference room which had an entire wall for a display screen,
and hours passed in the room as people rotated through, staring at the live
feed on the wall for hours, wondering, dreaming, speculating, imagining…&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What would they find?&nbsp; Would it feel more familiar on
the surface than their colony planets or were they truly more people of their
new worlds more now than of Earth?&nbsp; What would the people still left on
Earth be like?&nbsp; Kobol’s basic reconnaissance scans showed that there were
indeed humans (or something like humans) on the surface, but not much more than
that was known.&nbsp; They detected no technology they deemed
interesting.&nbsp; Were they survivors with living memory of their once great
civilization, or were they people with no such memory and only wonderment at
the ruins which must still persist on the surface.&nbsp; So many questions…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After what seemed like an eternity, New Horizon inserted
once again into orbit around the Earth.&nbsp; The noble ship, after so long
away, was finally home.&nbsp; Its journey had brought it full circle back to
where it had started, and neither it nor its crew knew what lay in store for
them down on the surface after so long an absence.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class=MsoNormal>Chapter 11</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Alright
everyone, I can’t wait anymore.&nbsp; I called you all here so that we could
conference on what the different teams have been able to come up with so far
before we head down tomorrow.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn was addressing the other eleven crew members in the
conference room off of the bridge, the room where they’d spent so many hours
staring at the wall sized screen on the way to Earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>There
are so many questions Captain,” Keri Reed excitedly exclaimed.&nbsp; “Before we
got here the only thing on our mind was why Earth stopped transmitting to us
without any warning, but now that we’re here we realize how much more there is
to know about what happened to all of the space stations and outposts around
the system.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
our primary objective should help us answer all of the follow up questions we
also have; what can you say so far?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
we’ve been running continual scans of the surface since we arrived two weeks
ago and there are a few things we can say,” Felix offered.&nbsp; “There are no
EM transmissions to or from the surface, and we can’t detect any large scale
signalling going on surface to surface.&nbsp; As you recall we had to boost to
a higher orbit soon after our arrival to avoid all of the orbital debris in low
orbit.&nbsp; We also didn’t detect any activity from any of the spacecraft seem
to be left intact down there either.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Anything
left in orbit of interest?” Kathryn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh
yes,” Keri answered, “I mean, from my perspective everything down there is of
interest and worthy of study, but especially of interest is the massive space
station which if I’ve read the limited archives we have correctly, is actually
the station which the New Horizon originally launched from.&nbsp; Apparently it
was once part of a triad of orbital platforms, but only the largest one is
still left intact.&nbsp; I guess it had the most onboard fuel for its automated
systems to keep it in orbit.&nbsp; It’s deserted; we can’t detect any life
onboard.&nbsp; Oh, and by the way it’s dangerously close to re-entry, it won’t
last another hundred years if nothing is done.&nbsp; We’ll want to board it and
resupply its fuel to prevent that from happening.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Wouldn’t
that station have the archive data you’d want?” Kathryn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Negative,”
Irvina answered.&nbsp; “All electronic data storage systems will have degraded
beyond recovery over that amount of time.&nbsp; The New Horizon archives are so
valuable to everyone because the physical backup can survive for millions of
years.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>But
there’s got be physical evidence down on the surface,” Keri pressed, “things
that could help you piece together the history of Earth before or after your
departure.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,”
Irvina acknowledged, “that was our back up plan but pursuing the New Horizon
archive was a much more practical pursuit to attempt first.&nbsp; That’s why
our government wasn’t in a rush to explore Earth since what we were looking for
we were seeking somewhere else first.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
see.&nbsp; So what about the other two stations?&nbsp; What happened to them?”
Kathryn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>They
went down…&nbsp; You can see here,” Irvina pointed out as she brought an image
up on the wall screen, “mid latitude on the African continent there’s a series
of craters consistent with a large space station breaking up while de-orbiting
and striking the ground in a linear series of impacts.&nbsp; We could only find
the one pattern on the planet though, the other must have come down in the
ocean somewhere.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Understood,”
Kathryn acknowledged.&nbsp; “So what about all of the other settlements there
were supposed to be elsewhere in the system?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No EM
traffic, no signs of any kind of activity from the ones we can see through the
ship’s telescopes from here,” Felix answered her.&nbsp; “Of course we only take
quick looks though, we’ve been primarily focused on Earth.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Obviously
we’re, well…” Keri corrected herself with a slight giggle.&nbsp; “I, am as
anxious to investigate those outposts as much as Earth.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Understood
Reed,” Kathryn acknowledged with a smile as she put her hand on the woman’s
shoulder.&nbsp; “But, on to the main event as they say.&nbsp; What have we
learned about Earth so far?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Interesting,”
Elim said as he laughed a little at himself over the obviousness of his
comment.&nbsp; “The onboard telescope network is equipped with infra-red
scanners which allow us to detect any living organism bigger than a human
child.&nbsp; The big news as you<span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>’</span>ve
all already heard is that there are indeed humans down there, or… at least
whatever has become of Earth humans.&nbsp; We’ve only found approximately half
a million people across the planet.&nbsp; Groups of a few hundred are scattered
all across the planet in all of the habitable environments.&nbsp; Most
interesting though is that there are quite a few larger colonies which appear
to be based around the few remaining water dams.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>There
are dams that have lasted this long?” Kathryn asked, nearly shocked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
yes,” Elim answered.&nbsp; “They didn’t build any more after fusion power was
developed but there were still thousands of them already built when Earth went
dark and there was no point in decommissioning them once they were already
there.&nbsp; They did a lot of environmental damage when they were built, but
once the damage was done they provided basically free energy.&nbsp; The nature
of the structures required them to be so robust that in general they could
structurally survive this long, so yeah, a few are still around even now.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Interesting.&nbsp;
But to what end?&nbsp; Why do are they clustering around hydroelectric dams?”
Kathryn asked.&nbsp; “For power?&nbsp; You said you didn’t detect any EM
activity.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I said
nothing large scale,” Felix corrected her.&nbsp; “Powering small devices or
machines left over from before, simple lighting… that sort of thing, all of
that could be powered by the energy provided by the dams and wouldn’t show up
on our scans.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Ok, so
have you found any indications so far of what caused Earth civilization to
collapse in the first place?&nbsp; What happened?” Kathryn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No,”
Francis admitted with some frustration.&nbsp; “There is no indication of mass
destruction consistent with a war or natural disaster, no indications of a
close encounter between this system and another large stellar body or alien
attack or harvesting operation… nothing.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
it looks like we’ve done all we can from orbit,” Kathryn surmised.&nbsp;
“Unless there are any other suggestions, we need to plan the next phase.&nbsp;
We’re going down.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
station,” Teresa said somewhat distantly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
about it?” Kathryn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>If we
want an explanation for what happened to Earth,” she leaned over the table, “it
might be a better place to look than the planet itself.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
makes you think so?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
it’s been six hundred years, whatever indications or evidence there may be down
there as to what happened, it’ll be badly degraded and tilled over by
now.&nbsp; Nature would reclaim settled areas alarmingly quickly.&nbsp; While
there is more likely to be evidence of some kind on the surface, if there is
any information to be found on that station it would be easier to find.&nbsp;
It might be a more practical first step.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
didn’t bring any additional atmospheric cyclers with us,” Jaren reminded them,
“just what we equipped New Horizon with.&nbsp; You’d have to stay in
environmental suits if you wanted to explore the station.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes…
but it’s a good idea though,” Kathryn considered out loud.&nbsp; “It already
made sense to split into teams.&nbsp; We’ll send one to the station, one to the
planet, and leave a team here on the ship to coordinate our activities.&nbsp;
We’ll take one of the two shuttles and drop off the station team before heading
down to the surface.&nbsp; If the station team runs into trouble they can be
assisted from the ship with the second shuttle.&nbsp; Teresa I’d like you to
lead the station team, along with Francis, Nadelle and Terey.&nbsp; Jaren you
stay on the ship and coordinate the mission with Xion, Parker, and Ana.”&nbsp;
Felix slumped and appeared severely disappointed.&nbsp; Kathryn put her hand on
his shoulder.&nbsp; “Sorry Felix, you’ll get your chance.&nbsp; The first
sortie won’t be the last.&nbsp; Irvina, I’ll need you with me to pilot the
ship, as well as Reed and Deirdre.&nbsp; Everyone understand?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes
Captain,” Jaren answered.&nbsp; “Now we just need to figure out where on the
planet you want to land.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Right…
where is the largest human settlement?” she asked, turning to the screen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Felix looked it up on his large scroll and when he found it
he put it up on the wall.&nbsp; “Looks like there are about a dozen across the
world of a similar size… but the largest population appears to be centred on a
dam in the north east of the North American continent where a large mountain
range gives way to prairie land.&nbsp; Coordinates fifty-six north one minute,
one-twenty-two west twelve minutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
we have no idea how they’ll respond to us if we just drop in on them out of the
blue sky.&nbsp; Bring up an image of the area for me Felix.”&nbsp; Her friend
acquiesced and the image was displayed on the wall.&nbsp; “Is this real time?”
she asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No
we’re on the other side of the planet at the moment, and we’ve been continually
changing our orbit to cover the whole planet once a week.&nbsp; This image is
as of five days ago.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Jaren
you’ll want to drop us off near the station but once you do, take up a
geostationary position over that settlement so that we can stay in
contact.&nbsp; The station will pass underneath you every hour and a half and
should only be out of communications for an hour at a time.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>If I
may make a suggestion Captain,” Jaren offered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Of
course,” she said with a smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It
appears that the original three stations were designed to fly in formation to
be in line of sight comms with every point on the planet outside of the polar
regions.&nbsp; If the New Horizons and our second shuttle take up appropriate
high orbit positons relative to the station, we can all stay in constant real
time contact with each other.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn considered the suggestion.&nbsp; “Do you see any way
that this would put the second shuttle at additional risk?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No
more risk than it is already in being in orbit and docked with the New
Horizon.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Alright,
that’s a good suggestion, thank you.&nbsp; We’ll go with Jaren’s suggestion.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
shuttle could be operated remotely but I’d be more comfortable if I sent Xion
out in it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s
your prerogative, will you be alright with just three people left on the ship?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh
yes, it’s a very automated ship and this will be a far safer place than
anywhere anyone else is going.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Right.”&nbsp;
Kathryn walked over to the wall screen for a close look.&nbsp; “It looks like
the main settlement is several kilometers east of the dam itself.&nbsp; If we
approach from the west and land a few kilometers away to the north of the dam
itself and to the west of the settlement we should be able to do so without
notice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How do
you plan to make contact?” Keri asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Very
carefully,” Kathryn said with a quirky look on her face.&nbsp; “Look, we are
going to have to make contact.&nbsp; Those people are themselves the best
resource we have for finding out what happened here.&nbsp; They’ll probably be
in possession of some sort of artifacts which might glean us some insights, or
even be able to tell us exactly what happened through their oral history.&nbsp;
Make no mistake, we are going down there to make contact, I just don’t want to
startle them with a flashy entrance like landing our alien spaceship in the
middle of their town or something.&nbsp; I intend to corner an individual or
small group of people on the outskirts of their settlement and explain to them
one on one who we are.&nbsp; Hopefully they’ll be happy to introduce us
peacefully to the others.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You’re
making a lot of assumptions,” Jaren warned her, with a not terribly subtle note
of concern for her safety in his voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
know, but we’re in the taking risks business here.&nbsp; It’s the safest risk
we could take and it’s worth it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren took a deep breath and nodded his acknowledgement, not
so much that he agreed as much as granting that it was her choice to make.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Alright,
you all have your instructions.&nbsp; Let’s get prepping for our respective
missions then.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>There
are other… let’s say unsavourty options I didn’t want to suggest in front of
the others,” Jaren told Kathryn.&nbsp; They were in the long engineering
corridor where the portals to the shuttles were among all of the engineering
access point to the fuel pods.&nbsp; It was their staging area while they were
making final preparations for their descent.&nbsp; “We could just capture one
or a few of the people down there and interrogate them here on the ship, or…
even just on the shuttle.&nbsp; It would allow us to use their clothes to blend
in and do some poking around before exposing ourselves.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She pulled him aside from the others out of sight.&nbsp; “I
considered that.&nbsp; But that carries risks of its own.&nbsp; I don’t want
our first point of contact to be an assault and abduction.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Frankly
I agree, but I felt obligated to point out the option regardless.&nbsp; Plus, I
worry about you…” he said as he gingerly drew the tip of his index finger down
her arm from her shoulder.&nbsp; She found it so remarkably intimate without
being sexual or possessive in any way.&nbsp; He seemed to just crave even so
simple and subtle a physical contact, and she reciprocated by taking his hand
into both of hers and holding it to her face momentarily.&nbsp; “I’m worries
about your team as well of course, not to mention Irvina.&nbsp; You know we’re
close.&nbsp; It’s dangerous out there.&nbsp; I wish I was coming along.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
know,” she said as she released his hand.&nbsp; “Don’t worry, we’ll be careful,
all of us.&nbsp; While I have you here though, there is something I was
wondering about.&nbsp; We won’t be able to get the Orbital One systems back
online because all of the operating system data will have been corrupted beyond
salvage over the centuries.&nbsp; The systems themselves should still be pretty
much intact though right?&nbsp; Could you or your people maybe write a basic
program which could allow us to start it up again?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren chuckled, and then took on an apologetic look when he
saw that she didn’t take his reaction very well.&nbsp; “I’m sorry, I didn’t
mean to laugh at you.&nbsp; It’s just that an operations system for a station
of that size and complexity, even a rudimentary one would take a whole team
working for months to be able to reverse engineer the system and figure out
functioning code for it.”&nbsp; Her question seemed to give him an idea
though.&nbsp; “But, since you ask…” he led her back to the others.&nbsp;
“Teresa, Parker, an idea of Ka- the Captain’s gave me one of my own.&nbsp; I
would bet that for something like the Orbital One station… well see, there’s no
reason to think that the New Horizon physical archive was a new technology
developed solely for that mission’s one massive archive.&nbsp; It would make
more sense that it was a technology already developed for any number of other
applications.&nbsp; In an entirely digital world, computer systems do
inevitably fail and some sort of manual full rebuilding of systems and
databases would be a required technology.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
are you suggesting?” Felix asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
think there’s at least a reasonable chance that on a facility like Orbital One
they would have stored somewhere a similar physical archive of at least the
basic operating system.&nbsp; Any number of things could go wrong and require
them to reboot their systems entirely from scratch, and that’s exactly what
they’d need to do so.&nbsp; It wouldn’t require anywhere near the amount of
data sheets as the New Horizon’s archives, it’s just an operating system as opposed
to the total knowledge of the species.&nbsp; If you can find them, which won’t
be easy since there won’t be any kind of functioning map or directory you could
use, plus you’ll have limited time, but if you could find such a backup we
could re-load the operating system and start turning systems on again.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I have
an idea…” Felix said as he pulled a medium scroll out of a pocket and unfurled
it.&nbsp; “I asked your people to send us regular updates of information we may
find relevant as they unpack the archives back at Kobol.&nbsp; They may have
gotten around to the specs of the station.”&nbsp; He poked around on it for
several seconds and then his face brightened with a broad smile.&nbsp; “Here,”
he said as he turned to be beside Jaren so he could see the screen as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Here it is, we’ve got it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Excellent!&nbsp;
Good thinking asking for those updates Felix.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I have
my moments,” he answered with a smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>So
where does it say the backups are located?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Conveniently
just beside the computer core itself along with all of the required reading and
transfer equipment.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
that will sure make things easier.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Presumably
we can get the computer systems online using power supplied by one of the those
anti-matter power sources you brought with you but that’ll only do so much for
so long.&nbsp; To really get the station going again we’ll have to restart the
onboard fusion reactors which shouldn’t be any trouble for a man of your
talents, but then we’d also need to resupply it with enough xenon for the ion
engines to stabilize its orbit, assuming they still work.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>One
thing at a time Parker, you said it had a hundred years before that was a
concern.&nbsp; Our primary objective this mission is just to figure out what
caused Earth’s collapse.&nbsp; There’ll be plenty of opportunity to come back
and do things like salvage Orbital One and explore the other outposts across the
system.&nbsp; Once there’s a clear path forward for that sort of thing, I
believe the Koboli government will be more interested.&nbsp; There could very
well be novel technologies worth investigating on the outposts elsewhere in the
system”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
it’s good to hear your people would be interested in something out here,”
Kathryn teased with a tone bordering very nearly with sarcasm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren gave an acknowledging nod and raised eyebrow which
suggested that he agreed with her frustration to some degree with his people’s
somewhat dysfunctional views and priorities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn put a consoling hand over his heart on his chest
before smiling at him and letting her hand slide down and off of him.&nbsp; She
turned and floated towards the airlock.&nbsp; “Everyone ready?” she
asked.&nbsp; Everyone acknowledged that they were and in response she called
out: “well then all aboard!&nbsp; This has been a long time coming!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Hold
up,” Kathryn commanded.&nbsp; “I want to make sure they’re okay before we move
on.”&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Koboli shuttle with Kathryn and and Teresa’s teams had docked
without incident at the central hub of Orbital One.&nbsp; At the very central
axis of rotation the station had a docking port with which an approaching
shuttle had to match the rotation of, and then hard lock onto.&nbsp; When the
station was fully operational and a hub of orbital traffic, those shuttles
would then be moved around the side of the central hub out of the way to make
room for another incoming shuttle, but those days were long gone.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately, there was a small shuttle blocking this main
docking port, and their own shuttle had to dock at one of the outer ports
designed for much larger ships.&nbsp; Four long tines extend out from the
central hub of orbital one like two pairs of giant pincers which provided
enough room for a much larger trans-planetary ship to dock at all four of them
at the same time.&nbsp; Two of those were occupied by just such ship as well,
but thankfully there were two which were open.&nbsp; For the larger vessels,
the tines as well as the docking points on the vessels were structurally reinforced
to tolerate the ships being carried around in a subtle circle along with the
station as it rotated.&nbsp; It was a fairly tenuous grapple for such a high
degree of torque, and without such structural reinforcements the ships were too
likely to sheer off of the tines with the force.&nbsp; Kathryn remarked that at
some point all of the ships docked here would have to be evaluated to
possibility of salvage, and in the back of her mind worried about the potential
for conflict between their worlds over who had claim to any such salvaged
ships.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teresa’s team were wearing environmental suits provided by
the Koboli, and they were equipped with cameras on the helmets which provided
the feed which Kathryn’s team was watching as they pulled themselves along the
long narrow corridor from the outer docking port to the central hub of Orbital
One.&nbsp; Kathryn remarked to herself how much the internal structure reminded
her of the central engineering corridor on the New Horizon itself, and she
wondered if there was anything to read into that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
have reached the central hub,” Teresa reported.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>This
portal will have to be pressure locked.&nbsp; It won’t open unless it detects
atmosphere on this side of the door.”&nbsp; He applied a battery pack to
bulkhead beside the control panel and the touch panel lit up in response but
there was nothing on it.&nbsp; “Yup, no response at all.&nbsp; Okay… well,
there’s gotta be a manual override somewhere…”&nbsp; He felt around the
perimeter of the hatch until he found a heavy hinged hole in the wall.&nbsp;
“Now this override could be… overridden by the operations team inside if they
were in there, but that shouldn’t be a problem.&nbsp; He pulled the thick
handle out of the wall, and turned it several rotations until the portal
unlocked and popped ajar.&nbsp; “Friends,” he said with a welcoming wave of his
hand, “welcome to Orbital One.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They entered onto what appeared to be a sort of arrivals and
departures bay with airlocks on all sides of them marked with large numbers
painted on them.&nbsp; Identifying the correct way towards the rest of the
station, they made their way along with hand and foot hold which were on every
surface to allow movement about the space in the absence of gravity.&nbsp;
Their way was lit by the lights on their helmets, and all of them were
quiet.&nbsp; They all had the overwhelming sense of walking through a
graveyard, a mixture of reverence and irrational fear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Investigating the end of the arrival and departure bay, they
found doorways to the four lifts which ran back and forth inside the struts
connecting the central core to the habitat ring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Like
the hatch into this area,” Felix said, “none of these door or lifts will work
for us.&nbsp; Even with power, with the operations programs so badly degraded
they wouldn’t know how to operate.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Options?”
Teresa asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>There’s
got to be an emergency crawlspace… ah, over here,” he noted.&nbsp; Francis used
a similar manual override to the one that got them past the tine to open the
way to a tubular pathway which was just large enough for them to make their way
single file up the way along the ladder which went off into the abyss as far as
their lights could make out.&nbsp; “Feet first everyone, you’ll experience
progressively increasing gravity until you get to the end so be careful.&nbsp;
Remember, if you damage your suit you’ll be in trouble.&nbsp; There’s atmosphere
here and you won’t die right away from vacuum, but the air is completely
anoxic, no oxygen to speak of, so watch your step.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One by one the team filed into the access tube and began
climbing down to the habitat ring.&nbsp; Halfway they felt a gravity level they
felt they were used to and began to worry.&nbsp; “Captain,” Teresa called out,
“we’re nowhere near the bottom and we’re already feeling heavy.&nbsp; Is the
station rotating faster than it should be?” she asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Jaren
can you calculate the rotational gravity at the habitat ring.&nbsp; Did we miss
something that important?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Could
be,” Jaren admitted.&nbsp; “We never did run the calculations.&nbsp; Give me a
second.”&nbsp; Jaren consulted his hand device.&nbsp; “Hunh,” he uttered.&nbsp;
“One point nine eight four.&nbsp; There’s nearly double gravity down there.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
hear that Teresa?” Kathryn asked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes…”
Teresa answered reservedly.&nbsp; “Is that safe?” she asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren turned to Ana on the New Horizon’s bridge.&nbsp; “In
theory… it shouldn’t be a problem,” Ana suggested.&nbsp; “It’ll be hell on them
physically, but… it’s survivable.&nbsp; It’ll tax their heart and circulatory
system, but they’re all healthy.&nbsp; We should limit their exposure just to
be safe though.&nbsp; I’d say no more than… two hours exposure at a time?&nbsp;
They could probably survive indefinitely in those conditions if they had to,
but it would still be prudent to limit their exposure.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
agree,” Elim confirmed.&nbsp; “We should work in two hour shifts.&nbsp; Two of
us should head back down and wait to switch off with you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,”
Teresa lamented.&nbsp; “We can’t climb past each other in this tunnel, so
Nadelle since you’re behind me follow me on up.&nbsp; Francis and Reed you head
back down to the central core and talk us through what we need to do.&nbsp;
We’ll switch up in a couple hours.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teresa and Nadelle continued climbing down as Francis and
Reed headed back to the central core.&nbsp; As Teresa and Nadelle continued on,
the weight became increasingly oppressive.&nbsp; Each step seemed to bring a
new strain on their bodies, but eventually they reached the bottom and climbed
off of the ladder and found themselves in a small room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Wow
that’s heavy,” Nadelle commented.&nbsp; “It’s almost hard to breathe, but… I
think I feel okay.&nbsp; How ‘bout you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well I
don’t feel my heart exploding or anything,” Teresa said, “but it’s hard to
stand up straight, hard to keep my head up.&nbsp; Ugh, and these damn suits
sure aren’t helping.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Scanning the room with her helmet lights, Nadelle looked
around the small room they found themselves in.&nbsp; “Ah,” she said, pleased
with herself at having found the door handle and pulling on the latch
handle.&nbsp; “Here we go.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When they opened the door and stepped out, they tripped over
something on the ground beneath them, and had to struggle considerably to stay
on their feet in the extra gravity.&nbsp; Pointing their lights down they saw
that it was a half decomposed human skeleton.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh
my…” Teresa said as she touched her glove to the front of her helmet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
that’s ominous,” Felix observed.&nbsp; “What do you make of it Nadelle?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Hard
to tell without further analysis, but I imagine it can’t decompose any further
in this anoxic air.”&nbsp; She pointed her helmet down the hallway one way and
then down the other. both ways of the hallway.&nbsp; “I can see one more down
the hall this way,” she offered, “but that’s it for now.&nbsp; I suggest we
press on.&nbsp; Answers to the bigger questions should shed light on the
smaller mysteries.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
agree,” Jaren said from the ship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Me
too.&nbsp; Press on,” Kathryn ordered from the shuttle.&nbsp; “I think we
should head on down to the planet now that you’re safely aboard.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Alright,
good luck.&nbsp; We should be fine.&nbsp; If we run into any trouble we’ve got
Jaren’s other shuttle for back up.&nbsp; Good luck Captain.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>To you
as well.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under Irvina’s direction, their shuttle disengaged from
Orbital One and began its descent towards Earth.&nbsp; Strapped into their
chairs, Kathryn, Elim, and Deirdre all marvelled at the projections on the wall
of the exterior.&nbsp; The sight took their breath away as Irvina focused on
piloting and navigation, the infinite starry expanse of space on one side, and
the impossibly high definition view which only reality could provide of the
Earth’s surface racing underneath them.&nbsp; The ship tilted over to the
appropriate angle of attack for the underside of the ship to directly confront
the planet’s atmosphere with their direction of travel.&nbsp; As the ship began
atmospherically braking, the image on the surfaces about them broke up and
flickered, left rendering only visual static as the imagers were disrupted by
the plasma of the atmosphere which became super-heated as they punched through
it and were slowed down as a result. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the image returned it took their breath away.&nbsp;
Beneath them were the rich green plains and snow-capped mountains of
Earth.&nbsp; Irvina seemed either disinterested or too busy with her work, but
the other three were free to be utterly captivated by the view.&nbsp; It wasn’t
their first time seeing a sight like this, but they were still far from being
used to it, if they ever could be.&nbsp; Beyond the sheer viscerality of the
view, it was near mystical experience of getting ever closer to a place of myth
and legend, a place some had begun to wonder if it had ever even existed only
couple of short months ago.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As they got closer and closer they could see the mountain
range they were descending upon in ever greater detail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Okay…”
Irvina said.&nbsp; “We’re coming up on the site you indicated.&nbsp; It’s just
on the other side of this mountain range.&nbsp; As indicated I’ll put us down
at the base of the last mountain five kilometers north of the dam.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The shuttle required only a tiny fraction of its total
thrust capacity to keep aloft and move across the surface of the planet.&nbsp;
At such low power it made hardly any sound at all though at full power it did
make quite a lot of noise.&nbsp; The crew watched as the ship hovered over the
spot of their final touchdown, and slowly descended down, blowing down and away
the knee high green tinged yellow grasses beneath them at a steady rate,
rhythmically accentuated by additional pulsing of energy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ship touched down on its metal legs which bent at their
joints to accommodate the weight.&nbsp; Irvina powered down the engines and set
all of the ship’s systems on standby.&nbsp; “Welcome to Earth,” she said as she
looked at them with a bit of a smirk, fully understanding the gravity of her
words on the others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Jaren?”
Irvina asked the communications system.&nbsp; “Is the triangle in position?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Negative.&nbsp;
Beta Team is still working their way towards the computer core on Orbital One
but they should be there soon.&nbsp; Until they get the station’s comms up and
running I sent Xion in the other shuttle to dock on the station as a life boat
in the meantime. Until then we’ll keep New Horizon in geostationary position to
maintain contact with your team and check in with Beta team whenever we have
comms.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Understood.&nbsp;
Well Captain Barnes, it’s your mission now, what’s our next move.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
move out.&nbsp; Everyone grab your gear.&nbsp; Irvina please open the door.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other woman nodded and waved her hand over her control
panel.&nbsp; A vertical slice of the interior of the shuttle fell away from the
top on its hinge at its bottom, revealing the view of the exterior which had
previously been projected onto the slice of wall which had fallen away.&nbsp;
It formed extended into a ramp all the way to the ground after doubling in
length with a projection extending from its interior.&nbsp; The air rushed in,
and Kathryn stepped to the doorway and took a deep breath through her nose,
savouring the fresh scent of air.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Careful
Captain,” Jaren warned.”&nbsp; I know you’re excited, but there’s a thousand
ways you could get into trouble on an alien world.&nbsp; I know its Earth but
don’t lose sight of the fact that for us it really is just that, alien.&nbsp;
It may feel to you like a long lost home, but… you still need to expect the
unexpected.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Your
concern is noted and appreciated Jaren,” Kathryn said with a smirk.&nbsp; “We
will proceed with all due caution.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cautiously she stepped down the ramp with the others
following behind her.&nbsp; She paused at the bottom of the ramp and hesitated
for a brieftly with the weight of the moment.&nbsp; She closed her eyes for a
brief moment as she set her first foot on Earth.&nbsp; Earth, she mused to
herself.&nbsp; She knew the word meant both the planet and the material on its
surface and as she brought her other foot to the ground she momentarily
relished the two senses of Earths she was standing on.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Overcome with emotion her eyes welled up with tears as she
looked back at the others and stepped out of the way to give the others room to
disembark as well.&nbsp; After Irvina stepped off a little too casually for
Kathryn’s taste, Terey hopped off of the last bit of ramp and enthusiastically
planted both feet into the ground with a wide grin towards Kathryn.&nbsp;
Deirdre disembarked last with an expression on her face which revealed her to
be experiencing something akin to a religious experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We’ve
got a bit of a walk people,” Kathryn said after wiping the wetness away from
her eyes.&nbsp; “We can take a moment here, but I’m eager to get moving.&nbsp;
We have limited daylight and we’ll need to walk back here before its dark.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before long they were on their way.&nbsp; When the space
allowed them they walked in a line, but when the terrain narrowed they fell
into a line.&nbsp; Terey marvelled at the birds which flew overhead while
Kathryn ran her fingers through the long grass.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A couple kilometers along, they were contacted by Jaren
again.&nbsp; “The station has come into range on a pass underneath us,” he
reported, “I’m opening the channels.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All four of the surface expedition team members were wearing
devices called PANEs they’d found on New Horizons.&nbsp; They were like
eyeglasses except they were outfitted with cameras and microphones and were
synched with their scrolls.&nbsp; Instead of corrective lenses, they held
screens in front of their eyes which could either be perfectly transparent,
augment their vision in any number of ways, or fully immerse them in displaying
video in stereo vision.&nbsp; They could hear Jaren and the station team
speaking to them through the tiny speakers in the ear piece part of the
device.&nbsp; “We’ve passed several other bodies along the way,” Teresa
reported, “but we have arrived at the computer core area and Jaren was
right.&nbsp; There is a storage compartment adjacent to it with the physical
backup memory sheets.&nbsp; It’ll take some time, but with Francis directing us
we should be able to power up the system with a Koboli power core and feed all
of the sheets into the reader.&nbsp; Then it should just be a matter of booting
up the main system compuer core.&nbsp; After that we should be able to get a
communications network up.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How
long have you been under that double gravity?” Terey asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Just
over an hour.” Nadelle reported.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How do
you feel?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh,
you know… we’re actually starting to get used to it.&nbsp; I mean it’s still
awful, but we’re managing.&nbsp; You think that maybe going back and forth
could be more stressful on the body than going back and for to limit our
exposure as we’d planned?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Irvina piped up.&nbsp; “There’s a chance that there may be
reserve thruster fuel enough to slow down the rotational speed once you get the
computers up and running.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
but we can’t count on that,” Jaren pointed out, and Irvina shrugged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Where
is the power core you brought with you?” Kathryn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Still
in the shuttle,” Francis answered from just outside the shuttle down in the
central hub.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Francis
you and Reed grab the power cell and… wait, Jaren where will they have to
install that core?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Hold on,”
Jaren requested.&nbsp; The four stood on the surface looking around at each
other waiting.&nbsp; “Down in the central hub actually, not far from where they
are now.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Right.&nbsp;
Francis and Reed go to the station’s main power bus.&nbsp; Install the energy
core but feed it only to the computer core and communications systems for now,
we don’t want to drain it too quickly by feeding the all of the station’s
systems at the same time.&nbsp; Once you’ve restored power to the computer
system Teresa and Nadelle can start feeding the sheets into the machine and you
can head to the core to replace them, finish feeding the sheets, set up the
comms relay, and then head back to the core section.&nbsp; That way you each
just get the two high gravity shifts and don’t have to go back and forth. &nbsp;You
should be able to access whatever you need to from down in the core section or
have Jaren access remotely.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Sounds
like a plan,” Teresa offered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Once
you’re both back to the centre we can evaluate further salvage option for the
station and see if we can find any useful data in the sheets beyond just the
basic operating system.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everyone in all three places acknowledged their
understanding of the plan and everyone continued on their way.&nbsp; A few
kilometers further along the team came to a place where the wooded area of the
mountains gave way to a more of an open meadow, and they held up before moving
out into the more exposed area.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class=MsoNormal>Chapter 12</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Emerging from the forest into the meadow, Kathryn’s team
found their way to a river which was flowing down from the mountains at their
back.&nbsp; They remembered from the topological maps and imagery of the colony
site that this river would eventually lead them right into the middle of the
town they were on their way to investigate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An hour and a half after the last communication, Jaren had
contacted them again to give them an update on the progress the Orbital One
team was making.&nbsp; “They’ve successfully powered up the central processor
and comm system,” he reported, “but they’ve only just begun to feed the data
sheets in to restore the operating system.&nbsp; Shouldn’t be long now, they
should be finished by the time they orbit beneath us again.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Good
to hear,” Kathryn affirmed.&nbsp; “Keep us posted.&nbsp; Surface team out.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m
most interested in knowing if there is indeed enough rotational control fuel
left to stabilize the gravity,” Irvina commented.&nbsp; “One would think that
automated systems would have used up the last drop maintaining orbital
altitude, but if there is still some left we should eventually be able to
restart the reactors and fully restore the station.&nbsp; That would be nice.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn shook her head a little with a grin towards the
ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What,”
Irvina asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Nothing,”
Kathryn answered, “it’s just… I wish the rest of your people could get into
this they way you can.&nbsp; Was Orbital One and the other facilities in the
system not a big enough lure for them, even if they’re only interested in
technology?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It’s
enough of a curiosity for us to have gotten around to it eventually,” Irvina
suggested with a thoughtful wrinkle above her nose, “but other things like
establishing rifts around more stars has so far taken priority.&nbsp; It’s more
a question of… allocation of resources than a total and complete lack of
curiosity.&nbsp; As for myself I’m an engineer, and getting the station up and
running is just a problem I’m happy trying to work.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Right.&nbsp;
Well no one would be happier than me if we can save that station and get it
operational.&nbsp; The possibilities are endless if we can.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Deirdre grabbed at Kathryn’s shirt from behind and when she
looked back at her the woman had a finger to her lips, indicating for her to be
quiet.&nbsp; She then motioned towards the ground for her to get low and
hide.&nbsp; The four of them got as low as they could in the impression the
river had cut into the valley.&nbsp; This left them belly down on the river
bank, peeking over the top.&nbsp; They saw a group of six humans off in the
distance walking in their direction along the bank of the river, beyond a bend
off to one side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mangy was the only word which came to Kathryn’s mind in
description of them.&nbsp; Their hair was either cut very short and very
roughly, or was past their shoulders in thick clumps.&nbsp; From a distance one
might think they were rough braids, but upon more careful inspection the hair
was just incredibly dirty and great clumps of it clung together.&nbsp; Their
clothing appeared to consist of animal skins and furs, but Kathryn was struck
by how well tailored the primitive clothing nevertheless appeared to be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
there they are,” Terey observed.&nbsp; “What’s the play?” he asked Kathryn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m
going to go say hi,” she mused, amusing herself with her own casual
remark.&nbsp; “Alone,” she told them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Captain?”
Irvina asked with concern.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>All of
us emerging at once could scare them off.&nbsp; They could run back to their
camp in panic and create all kinds of problems for us here.&nbsp; Low impact is
what’s called for here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Very
well, but we should inform Jaren.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>As you
wish,” Kathryn acceded.&nbsp; It was indeed prudent to do so.&nbsp; “Jaren?”
she asked after pressing a small button on the side of her PANEs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We’ve
spotted some… Earthlings?” she said in a questioning tone with raised shoulders
as she looked to the others for their opinion of her use of the term.&nbsp; The
rest shrugged their lack of a better one to use.&nbsp; “Some people anyways,
and I’m going to attempt to contact them alone.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Alone?”&nbsp;
Kathryn could hear his eyebrow raising from hundreds of kilometers away.&nbsp;
“Are you sure that’s wise?” he asked as casually as he could, which was less
casually than he would have liked.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Wise
or not, it’s what I’m doing.” she answered definitively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Very
well,” Jaren said with unspoken reservation, “we’ll monitor your progress from
here on the ship’s telescopes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn gave a single nod to herself in confirmation that
the conversation was over and closed the channel.&nbsp; “Alright, wish me
luck…” she offered nonchalantly to the other three before cautiously raising
her head and climbing over the ridge.&nbsp; The group was about half a
kilometer away and when she emerged she put her hands above her head in what
she hoped would be the interstellar gesture of ‘I come in peace, please don’t
attack me.’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The earthlings seemed to squack and scramble in a bit of a
frenzy before settling down and cautiously advancing on her as she did the
same.&nbsp; The experience was surreal for her.&nbsp; Until very recently it
was unknown if Earth itself still existed, now here were humans just like her
whom she was getting to meet on it!&nbsp; The last couple months her life so
far seemed to be one continuous string of ever greater peaks experiences one
after another and here she was, her life newly peaked yet again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A couple hundred meters from each other she began calling
out greetings, the standard ‘hello’ and ‘I come in peace’.&nbsp; She could see
them smiling and nodding as if they understood her.&nbsp; They were making no
attempts to directly communicate with her and this increasingly began to put
her ill at ease.&nbsp; She more and more got the impression that they were
placating her, trying not to scare her off even more than she was trying not to
scare them away.&nbsp; Closing to less than a hundred meters she began to feel
more and more like she was walking grinning like an idiot into an obvious trap.&nbsp;
As they closed to less than fifty meters from each other, they still had yet to
make any attempt to communicate with her and at about the point she was on the
edge of turning around and running for her life, one of them pulled out a long
straight tube, put it to his lips, and blew a dart at her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The dart hit her in the chest, and her first reaction was
one of simple curiosity, wondering what this meant and why they had done
this.&nbsp; When she began to feel drowsy a couple seconds later she came to
understand the significance.&nbsp; She pulled the dart out and tried to turn
and run, but she only tripped over her feet as she found herself increasingly
impaired by whatever had been in the dart.&nbsp; She hit the ground and the
last thing she remembered before losing consciousness was the feeling of many
foreign hands touching her body, and being lifted up over somebody’s shoulder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>KATHRYN!!!”&nbsp;
Jaren cried out on the bridge of the ship as he watched this all happen from a
bird’s eye view on his monitors.&nbsp; He frantically opened a channel to the
rest of the surface team who were still hiding in the gulley of the
river.&nbsp; “You have to go after her!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
don’t think that’s wise.” Irvina harshly replied.&nbsp; Her, Terey, and Deirdre
had seen the entire event as well, between peeping up over the ridge and
watching the same telescope view on their scrolls which Jaren had been
observing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>But
you have to!&nbsp; She’s, she’ll, they…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Jaren!”
Irvina said with a harsh tone nobody had heard her take with her superior
officer before.&nbsp; “We are unarmed, and they have a poison dart which is
merely incapacitating at best.&nbsp; If we go after her, now, like this, we are
likely only to suffer the same fate as her whatever that is.&nbsp; You will
continue to monitor her from orbit while we return to the New Horizon.&nbsp; We
plan our next move from there.&nbsp; If we want to mount a rescue assault we
can do so very quickly and I’m happy to lead it myself, but I’m hoping a better
option will present itself.&nbsp; Such an action would be dangerous, and more
so the more we rush without thinking.&nbsp; Are we clear?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes
Irvina… yes of course you’re right.&nbsp; Please return to orbit as soon as you
can so we can discuss our options.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
thought Jaren was your superior,” Terey questioned Irvina.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>He is…
technically.&nbsp; But we have a history.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Terey raised his eyebrow at her.&nbsp; “History?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Irivina sighed.&nbsp; “We used to be married.&nbsp; A long
time ago.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Ah.&nbsp;
Now I get it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
don’t seem as panicked about losing Kathryn as I’d expect.&nbsp; Neither of you
do.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Good
training,” Terey shrugged.&nbsp; “And we haven’t lost her, I have every
intention of getting her back safe and sound.&nbsp; Losing our heads certainly
won’t help us do that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Good
training indeed,” Deirdre observed.&nbsp; She looked at the scroll showing the
telescope imaging.&nbsp; For now they seem to just be carrying her back to
their town.&nbsp; We obviously have to do something, but we can’t do anything
right now and there’s no indication she’s in immediate danger.&nbsp; Let’s get
back to the ship as quick as we can.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Agreed,”
Irvina nodded.&nbsp; “Try to keep up.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Back on the ship, Irvina, Terey, and Deirdre met Jaren on
the bridge.&nbsp; He was alone, so the rest of his New Horizon team must have
been assigned to various tasks about the ship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Status?”
Irvina asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>They’ve
taken her into their town and put her in a small single room structure.&nbsp;
The infra-red imager shows her alone and still unconscious on some kind of
bed.&nbsp; She seems alright at the moment.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Irvina looked at the monitors Jaren was so intently
observing and saw the false colour blue, yellow, and red infra-red image on the
monitor beside a true image of the roof of the structure on an adjacent
monitor.&nbsp; “And Orbital One?” she asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Up and
running,” Francis reported as he entered the bridge and came over to give a
long lingering hug to his daughter Deirdre.&nbsp; “The parts we need
immediately anyway.”&nbsp; Pulling away from his daughter he turned to
Terey.&nbsp; “I’m very sorry to hear about Kathryn, Terey.&nbsp; We’ll get her
back, don’t worry.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Damn
right we will,” Jaren stated definitively.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Loading
the operating system worked like a charm,” Francis continued, “so we can relay
comms through the station and set up an orbital triangle whenever we want to,
but we would need to take New Horizon out of geostationary over Kathryn to do
so.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We’re
not doing that.” Jaren said with a determined tone.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Irvina stared at him for a moment with contempt in her
eyes.&nbsp; “Nadelle is back onboard?” she asked Francis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Affirmative.&nbsp;
Everyone besides Kathryn is back on board.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Good.&nbsp;
Please take Terey and Deirdre and have Nadelle meet you in the medical
bay.&nbsp; I want her to run a complete medical examination of them with Koboli
equipment, right down to the molecular level.&nbsp; You never know what we
might have picked up down there.&nbsp; I’ll meet you there for my own exam
shortly.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Understood;
prudent precaution.&nbsp; Come along you two, poke and prod time.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She stood in silence behind Jaren, waiting for him to notice
her looking at him expectantly.&nbsp; Finally she came around to stand in front
of him, between him and the monitors he was staring at.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Jaren.&nbsp;
We need to talk.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Of
course,” he said as he shifted his gaze to another set of monitors she wasn’t
blocking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Jaren!”
she yelled angrily.&nbsp; “I know what’s going on but you need to focus.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He looked at her finally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We are
all worried about Barnes and we are all going to do whatever we can to get her
back, understand?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I love
her.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh for
fuck’s sakes…”&nbsp; She rubbed both eyes with her thumb and forefinger.&nbsp;
“I know,” she said with a roll of her hand.&nbsp; “We all know!”&nbsp; This
time she waved back at the crewmembers who had just left.&nbsp; “I know you two
thought you were being subtle but you failed utterly.&nbsp; It’s the worst kept
secret in the galaxy Jaren.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He seemed wounded to her somehow, perhaps it was
embarrassment.&nbsp; She pulled up a rolling chair and sat down in front of
him.&nbsp; “I know you love her Jaren, but you don’t have a monopoly on being
worried about her, alright?&nbsp; We all are, and we all need to have our heads
definitively out of our asses if we’re going to get her back safe, right?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren shook his head as if knocking cobwebs loose.&nbsp;
“Right, of course.&nbsp; I’m sorry Irvina, we really thought that we could keep
things secret.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We all
knew that was your intent so we indulged you.&nbsp; I’m your second in command
though, it’s my job to snap you out of it if you get lost.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Right.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m
also somebody who cares about you, remember?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren smiled.&nbsp; “Yes, thank you.&nbsp; I cherish you in
my life Irvina.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Great.&nbsp;
So now that that’s out of the way, we need a plan to get her back.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Leaving Xion on the bridge to keep an eye on things, the
rest of the crew convened in the conference room.&nbsp; Nadelle had discovered
something curious while conducting medical examinations of Terey and Deirdre
and wanted to share it with everyone at once.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We’ve
found something in examining the surface team which might answer a lot of our
questions.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Go
on,” Jaren said, leaning in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
we may have solved the mystery of why Earth went dark!” Terey excitedly
exclaimed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well…
let’s not get ahead of ourselves,” Nadelle cautioned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
don’t know how you could see it any other way!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Hey!”
Irvina exclaimed, taking on more of a leadership role in Kathryn’s
absence.&nbsp; “Slow down.&nbsp; Start from the beginning.&nbsp; Explain.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It was
a virus,” Terey explained.&nbsp; “A virus which… we’ve all presumably been
infected with now.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>So,
are we… all going to die then?” Parker asked, attempting to blunt his mortal
fear with nonchalant humour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No,”
Nadelle replied.&nbsp; “Well ultimately yes of course, but not… from this
virus.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
advanced medical technologies of the Koboli are capable of dealing with it and
curing us of it, but the New Horizon’s medical chambers can’t even detect its
presence.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How
does this solve the mystery of Earth?” Teresa asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>If
Earth technology of the era this ship launched in doesn’t even recognize it,
then it certainly couldn’t cure it,” Ana explained.&nbsp; “We suspect that the
entire global population suffered a catastrophic die off as a result of this
virus in the environment.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Several people put a hand to their mouths to stifle their
gasps.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s
horrific,” Reed commented.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well…”
Parker said, “based on the limited population down there now, we knew that
something like this must have happened at some point.&nbsp; If this thing is so
fatal, why are there any people left down there at all?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nadelle shrugged.&nbsp; “Natural immunity I suppose.&nbsp;
It’s common for even the most pernicious infectious diseases to leave a small
percentage of the population immune by chance, by an unexpected quirk of
physiology.&nbsp; Even if point-oh-one percent had some sort of natural
immunity, from a population of ten billion…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Right,
that’d still be a million people,” Parker observed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Which
sounds like a lot,” Deirdre commented, “but for a global population that’s
nowhere near enough to sustain a high technology culture like Earth had had
beforehand.&nbsp; Especially when you consider that’s young and old, and a
completely randomized selection of what professional skills the people still
left around happen to have.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Exactly,”
Nadelle agreed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
more can you tell us about the virus?” Jaren asked her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
it was synthetic for one.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Meaning…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Meaning
it was engineered, deliberately.&nbsp; Either it was something experimental
being worked on in a laboratory which just happened to be released
accidentally, or…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Or for
some reason it was developed and released maliciously,” Ana said, finishing the
thought for Nadelle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
don’t… I don’t know what to make of that,” Jaren admitted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It
doesn’t matter much now,” Terey offered somewhat distantly.&nbsp; “However it
happened, that’s definitely what happened.&nbsp; At least we know now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a somber moment of reflection which hung in the
air for several moments before anyone spoke up again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’d
like to refer you back to my original question regarding… are we going to die?”
Felix reiterated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No.&nbsp;
I’ve already cured myself, Terey, Deirdre…&nbsp; Although it wasn’t recognized
by New Horizon’s medical facilities, the medical equipment we brought with us
from Kobol made rather quick work of it.&nbsp; When we’re done here I can cure
the rest of you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
didn’t realize Koboli medical technology was so advanced,” Reed commented.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s
the funny thing, actually.&nbsp; It’s not,” Nadelle offered.&nbsp; “I mean it
certainly is more advanced, but not that much.&nbsp; This virus seems to have
been specifically engineered to not be detectable to modern Earth medical
technology of the day.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>So it
was developed maliciously,” Jaren asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
still couldn’t state that definitively,” Nadelle countered.&nbsp; “Researchers
could easily have developed something like this just to learn about it and how
they might counter it if someone else did.&nbsp; Biotech can be as much of an
arms race as anything else… there’s really no way to know.&nbsp; Don’t get me
wrong, it has all the appearances of being a weaponized virus, but such a thing
could be developed specifically to figure out how to counter it if it was
developed by someone else.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Can
you tell me what the disease progression would be without treatment?” Jaren
asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Simulations
suggest that there would be no apparent symptoms for up to a week, during which
time it is highly virulent and contagious, followed by a rapid decline over
only a few hours resulting from multiple organ system failure.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Wow,”
Teresa uttered.&nbsp; She and several others seemed quite disturbed by the
description.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Like I
said,” Nadelle reiterated, “it’s weaponized.&nbsp; It’s designed to kill as
many people as possible, to be a… global killer.&nbsp; With how interconnected
Earth civilization would have been at the time, I’d bet most people on the
planet were infected before the first person died from it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Those
poor people…” Deirdre uttered.&nbsp; “What about the colonies elsewhere in the
system?&nbsp; What about all the ship in space while this was going on?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It
ultimately wouldn’t matter if they were infected or not,” Terey
explained.&nbsp; “Certainly many were, but even if they weren’t it would mean a
fate almost worse.&nbsp; There were no places off-world in the system which had
the capacity to be self-sustaining, that’s part of why all of our generational
starships were built in the first place.&nbsp; The outposts in one form or
another all still needed some sort of supply from Earth.&nbsp; If they didn’t
get infected and die right away, they’d… die when their supplies finally gave
out in the end.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Even
worse…” Reed commented.&nbsp; Terey seemed to agree with a slightly conflicted
nod.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Kathryn.”
Jaren uttered in a low voice through a tight face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes…”
Nadelle confirmed.&nbsp; “There can be no doubt that she was immediately
infected as well.&nbsp; If we can’t get to her before the rapid decline phase
of the disease…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
understand.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>But
one way or another, we’re not going to let that happen,” Parker stated firmly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No we
are not,” Jaren confirmed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class=MsoNormal>Chapter 13</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn woke up, but it wasn’t like any kind of waking up
she’d ever done before.&nbsp; It felt more like coming back from the dead than
rousing from a restful sleep.&nbsp; It took her a few moments to remember the
last thing she remembered, but when she did she bolted upright in her
bed.&nbsp; This was a mistake.&nbsp; It brought on a crushing pain in her head
and she had to lie back down again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At least the bed was comfortable enough.&nbsp; It seemed to
be a mattress shaped bag of sewn together animal hides, presumably stuffed with…
fuck did her head ever hurt.&nbsp; Lying down was helping the pain though; she
felt it slowly dissipating.&nbsp; She turned her head to the side to get a look
at her surroundings.&nbsp; She was in a smallish room which she imagined might
be the entire structure.&nbsp; The walls appeared to be built out of logs
stacked on top of each other and crossing each other in an interlaced way at
the corners.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She reached down to feel if she still had any equipment in
her pockets.&nbsp; She didn’t.&nbsp; Both her PANEs and her scroll were missing.&nbsp;
“Well at least there’s that…” she darkly humoured to herself in a croaked
voice.&nbsp; “Okay.&nbsp; Let’s try this again…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This time with an abundance of caution, she slowly raised
her head and worked her way up to a sitting upright position.&nbsp; Just as
cautiously, she swung her body around to put her feet on the ground beside the
bed.&nbsp; Looking down, she noticed that the floor was bare earth, dry and
packed down hard, but bare earth all the same.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As she was contemplating her chances of successfully
standing up, the door swung open and a young woman entered, younger than
Kathryn certainly, but she was still a grown adult woman.&nbsp; Kathryn was
struck by how different this woman looked to the humans she<span lang=JA
style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>’</span>d encountered before, the ones who had
darted her and presumably brought her here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The woman before her now was obviously quite clean and
freshly bathed.&nbsp; Her dark hair was tied back with a pink ribbon which
matched the pink flowers patterning her flowing and loose fitting white
sundress.&nbsp; She had an air of arrogant confidence about her, the kind one
might expect from an aristocrat or a person of some other position of unearned
privilege.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>English?”
the woman asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I…
yes!” Kathryn marvelled.&nbsp; “Why do you speak, I mean, am I… what’s going on
here?”&nbsp; She didn’t know what to ask first so she blurted out several
partial questions at once.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
land do you come from?” the woman asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Land?&nbsp;
I… I don’t understand.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How
far did you travel to get here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Pretty
fucking far…” Kathryn chuckled to herself and the woman wrinkled her nose in
confusion.&nbsp; “Why was I attacked?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
were alone, in unfamiliar clothing.&nbsp; Our explorers thought it best to
capture you first and investigate secondly.&nbsp; Perhaps not the wisest
decision, but… their strengths are not their wisdom.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What’s
your name?” Kathryn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Patricia.&nbsp;
And you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Kathryn.”
Patricia merely acknowledged with a nod.&nbsp; “Are you the leader here
Patricia?” Kathryn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No,
but I do serve the leader.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’d
like to meet your leader.&nbsp; I have many questions, and I’d like us to be
friends.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Perhaps.&nbsp;
How did you find yourself alone in our lands?&nbsp; Certainly you were not
foolish enough to have travelled so far alone.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I was
not alone.&nbsp; I had friends with me who must have retreated after seeing
what you did to me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>They
have abandoned you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>They’ll
be back for me, you can be sure of it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
see.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
can’t help but notice your clothes… they are very nice compared to the animal
skins I saw the others wearing.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Serving
the leader has privileges.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yeah.&nbsp;
It usually does doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Patricia tilted her head to the side in a questioning
way.&nbsp; “What land do you come from?” she asked again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Haven,”
Kathryn answered for lack of a better reply with a shrug.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I have
not heard of this land.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No I
wouldn’t suspect you had.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another tilt of her head to the side.&nbsp; “You had this
equipment with you.”&nbsp; Patricia produced her PANEs and scroll.&nbsp; She
pulled the scroll apart and looked accusingly at Kathryn.&nbsp; “We’d hoped we
could learn about your land and its people from this scroll but it is password
protected.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
know what a scroll is?” Kathryn asked with great surprise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,”
Patricia answered matter of factly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
go ahead then.&nbsp; The password is KB4186.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Patricia entered the characters into the scroll and it
unlocked for her.&nbsp; The first thing she did was search the term ‘Haven.’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Haven…
is a planet?” she asked with great surprise as she raised her head to look up
at Kathryn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s
right,” Kathryn answered cautiously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
are attempting to deceive me,” Patricia accused.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No,
it’s the truth, I swear…&nbsp; Like I said, I’ve come from very, very far
away.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>So it
would seem.&nbsp; And yet you are human?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It’s a
long story.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I look
forward to hearing it.&nbsp; So will the leader.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How do
you know what a scroll is?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Some
technology has survived from ancient times.&nbsp; It is rare, but we who serve
the leader are privileged to have access to it.&nbsp; The dam provides us the
energy we require to power and use the technology we have.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I see…
that’s why all of the settlements are near dams.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes.&nbsp;
If we can maintain the dams, not only do they supply us with all the water we
could ever need, but they can also power the technology we have been able to
scavenge.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Is
that what your explorers were doing?&nbsp; Leaving on an expedition to find
more?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes.&nbsp;
We can maintain a simple way of life without discovering new supplies, but
luxuries and tools we cannot create ourselves must be scavenged by our
explorers.&nbsp; Perhaps by design, the dams which power the tools we find are
never near the places we can find the tools.&nbsp; The journey to the lands of
the south where such treasures are to be found is a very treacherous one.&nbsp;
Our expedition teams leave in the spring and camp in the south for the winter
before heading home the following spring.&nbsp; Sometimes…” the woman looked down
with a minor welling up of sadness.&nbsp; “Sometimes they do not come back at
all.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
see,” Kathryn offered sympathetically.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Composing herself, Patricia asked: “how did you come here
from Haven?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>On a
ship, a starship called the new New Horizon.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Patricia eyed her skeptically.&nbsp; “I find this
unlikely.&nbsp; The stories say that such a journey would take many lifetimes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Ordinarily
it would,” Kathryn admitted, “but we met some new friends recently who have the
technology to get us here much quicker.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How
quickly?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Weeks.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Patricia was quiet for a few moments before admitting: “I
would very much like to meet these friends of yours.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m
positive they’d like to meet you as well.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
if nothing else I am satisfied that the leader would no doubt very much like to
meet you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Grand!&nbsp;
Can I have my equipment back?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No.”
Patricia answered firmly.&nbsp; “The leader may see fit to return these to you,
but that is her prerogative, not mine.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Very
well.&nbsp; Does your leader have a name?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
call her The Great Moll.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
see.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>There!&nbsp;
See?&nbsp; She’s on the move!” Jaren exclaimed.&nbsp; He had been watching very
intently since Kathryn had shown the first signs of rousing.&nbsp; He watched
with great curiosity as a woman entered the structure Kathryn had been taken to
and as he watched them talk he burned to know what was being said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After a time, they both emerged from the structure, and
Jaren had a small sense of relief being able to see her in true image with the
satellite instead of an infra-red outline, even if it was just the top of her
head.&nbsp; He didn’t have to watch long before he observed her steal a moment
to look up into the sky and give a thumbs up.&nbsp; It was an ultimately
ambiguous message, but Jaren resolved himself to accept that it meant that she
was alright, at least for the moment.&nbsp; He continued to watch as the two
women sat on the bank of the river in anticipation of a third figure seeming to
bring them some food.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Of all
things…” he muttered to himself, “a frickin picnic.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Looks
like she’s doing just fine without us doesn’t it?” Felix observed over his
shoulder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh,
Parker.&nbsp; Yeah, well… we can’t really know what’s going on down there, or
what’s going to happen.&nbsp; How are we for supplies?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
all told we’ve been able to assemble quite a little arsenal for ourselves for
when we go down to get her.&nbsp; We’ve got four of your, um… magic wand things
which Irvina tells me can render someone unconscious with a touch.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s
right.&nbsp; And it’s just ‘wands’”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Right.&nbsp;
And… we’ve got plenty of scrolls which according to my research are capable of
emitting a particularly pernicious flashing of light which overloads the visual
system and knocks people out.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Good,
good… what else?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
there’s not a drop left in the ship’s printers, they were drained to make as
many tools as we could before abandoning the ship, but I’ve looked into it and
there are a number of things on the ship which with some work could be reduced
to printing material.&nbsp; The food trays in the dining hall for instance,
with some processing the plastic could be recycled to make crossbows or
something… we could even harvest some of the internal bulkheads to print some
firearms, if… if we wanted to go that far.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren swiveled around to face Felix.&nbsp; “Well Parker…
from what I understand you’re her best friend, how far do you think we should
be willing to go to get her back?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After a moment to consider the question, Felix answered: “I
have never taken a life… and I don’t ever want to.&nbsp; But I could, if it was
what was necessary to save her.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s
exactly how I feel.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Felix nodded with a raised eyebrow, indicating that he
believed Jaren did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
thing is though,” Felix added, “I don’t think Kathryn herself would want us to
save her if that was the cost of doing so.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It’s
not up to her though is it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No,
but we should consider what she’d want us to do.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes.&nbsp;
Yes of course, you’re right.”&nbsp; Jaren weighed his options.&nbsp; “We will
make every effort to recover her without hurting anyone, but if it does comes
down to them or her…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>If it
comes down to them or her, I won’t argue.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m
glad we understand each other.&nbsp; I understand you are an active member of
your world’s military, same as Kathryn?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
paramilitary would be more accurate, but yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
that makes you the closest thing we have onboard to a soldier.&nbsp; You can
handle a firearm?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
can.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Then
print yourself whatever gun you feel most appropriate for yourself, as well as
a few crossbows for others.&nbsp; If they make any aggressive move against her
we’ll launch immediately, but that would be the most dangerous option and it
could potentially be very messy.&nbsp; Hopefully another opportunity will
present itself.&nbsp; I suspect that if it does… we’ll know it when we see it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Eventually Jaren managed to sleep.&nbsp; He could have
gotten a pill from Nadelle, but that would have prevented him from being
sufficiently alert should things seem to go bad down on the surface.&nbsp;
Nothing seemed to go that way though.&nbsp; Kathryn stayed close to the woman
who had greeted her in the building they had brought her to when she was
unconscious.&nbsp; She appeared to be being given some sort of tour of the
encampment, and their best guess was that she was conducting the diplomacy
which (as surprising as it may have been to Kathryn herself) seemed to come
quite naturally to her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When night fell, she seemed to join some others around a
camp fire on the outskirts of the settlement before finally retiring to her
room for the night.&nbsp; Seeing this, the whole crew tried to get some rest,
hoping that the next day would present an appropriate opportunity.&nbsp; If such
an opportunity didn’t present itself in the next couple days, they would have
to risk a direct incursion before it was too late to save her from the virus
which was growing stronger in her body every minute until it eventually killed
her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the morning, after watching her get some breakfast with
her companion, they began to see some indication that they were preparing for
some sort of trip.&nbsp; Felix had finished manufacturing his weapons, and
Nadelle had prepared a transdermic which would cure Kathryn if they could get
it to her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When they saw the two women leave the settlement and head
west accompanied by two males, Jaren gave the order and he along with Irvina,
Felix, Elim, Teresa, and Francis all piled into one of the two Koboli
shuttles.&nbsp; Leaving Xion in command of the New Horizon, the shuttle
detached from the ship began its descent into the Terran atmosphere.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Feeling no need for subtlety at this point, even suspecting
a little shock and awe might work in their favour, Jaren brought the ship
directly down towards Kathryn’s location.&nbsp; Descending rapidly, he expertly
conducted an emergency landing only a hundred meters away from Kathryn’s
party.&nbsp; The door flew open and Jaren’s team poured out with all manner of
weapons pointed at Kathryn’s captors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “HALT!!&nbsp;
Let her go!&nbsp; We don’t want to hurt anybody but we will if we have
to!”&nbsp; Jaren didn’t know if they spoke English or not but he figured it was
a good bet based on how much Kathryn seemed to have been conversing with them
over the last couple day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Jaren!&nbsp;
No!!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren looked at the others in confusion as one of the males
accompanying Kathryn stood behind her and held a knife to her throat.&nbsp; “Go
back where you came from or she dies!” the man yelled at Jaren.&nbsp; He seemed
startled at least if not fearful of their unexpected sudden arrival, but there
was no ambiguity around the seriousness of his threat.&nbsp; “We are taking her
to see the leader, only she can release her if she wishes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Unacceptable!&nbsp;
She is coming with us!&nbsp; Let her go!&nbsp; You will die if you hurt her at
all I’m not screwing around!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Neither
are we!”&nbsp; He was much cooler, much more in control of the situation than
Jaren.&nbsp; “You leave now or she dies!” A small trickle of blood began to
flow from where he was holding the knife to Kathryn’s throat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Jaren!”
Kathryn croaked, “do what he says!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>But-”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Do
what he says!!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
lower our weapons, and you take the knife off her throat…&nbsp; Okay?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
first.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Okay,
okay…” Jaren said.&nbsp; In the moment if he could see a way of freeing her by
killing he would have, but he didn’t see any way to accomplish that without
getting her killed.&nbsp; It was also clear how much Kathryn didn’t want him to
do any such thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I… we
have to treat you Kathryn, there’s, there’s a disease!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What?”
she asked in confusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Enough!”&nbsp;
The man yelled.&nbsp; “You get out of here!&nbsp; Get back in that thing and
leave now!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>But,
I-”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>NOW!!”
the man screamed as he put the knife to Kathryn’s throat again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>FUCK!!”
Jaren burst in frustration.&nbsp; “ALRIGHT!&nbsp; FINE!!!”&nbsp; Jaren was
incensed by his impotence to extract Kathryn.&nbsp; “We’ll find another way!”
he reassured her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Do
nothing!” she implored him past the knife.&nbsp; “Just wait, I’m okay
really!&nbsp; I should be able to contact you by the end of the day, if not-”
the man put his hand over her mouth to prevent her from saying anything
more.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After everyone else had re-embarked Jaren stomped onboard
and as the door swung up he punched one of the wall screen in anger and
frustration so hard it cracked in a spiderweb out from the point of
impact.&nbsp; Jaren cried out in pain and clutched his hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Dammit
Jaren,” Elim exclaimed.&nbsp; “Your hand, you dumbass!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
did you call me!?” he yelled with fire in his eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>HEY!!”
Irvina yelled, “everybody just calm the fuck down!&nbsp; Computer, take us back
up the ship immediately.&nbsp; Jaren, you are a dumbass, and you will sit the
hell down and let Elim have a look at your hand.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Irvina!?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
will sit the fuck down and get a fucking grip on yourself.”&nbsp; She
successfully stared him down and he began the long process of returning to
centre.&nbsp; “We are returning to the ship, we will assess our situation and
plan our next move.&nbsp; There’s nothing else we can do here now.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>So, is
this how you treat all of your guests?” Kathryn asked Patricia as she dabbed at
the wound on her neck with the sleeve of her shirt and then pressed it to stop
the bleeding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Fenn
and the rest of the men can be… overzealous, but he was not wrong.&nbsp; Your
people should not have done that.&nbsp; He did what he had to do.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How
can you say that?&nbsp; You condone me being treated that way?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Your
fate shall be decided by the leader, and the leader alone.&nbsp; Your friends
will not be allowed to interfere.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Then
we’d better get there already, shouldn’t we?” she asked acidly.&nbsp; “I’d hate
to keep the fates waiting.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Patricia held out her hand for Kathryn to lead the way and
she headed on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Jaren
mentioned something about a disease.&nbsp; You know what he was talking about?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Perhaps,”
Patricia answered.&nbsp; “The stories tell of a disease, a plague that brought
about the end of ancient times.&nbsp; The Great Moll teaches us that we are the
descendants of a blessed people, those who were spared from the plague.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>This
plague… it must still be around, that must be what Jaren was talking
about.&nbsp; He must have a cure… you should have let him treat me Patricia, I
could die.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>There
is no cure.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
my friends are very resourceful.&nbsp; What can you tell me about this
disease?&nbsp; What are the symptoms?&nbsp; How long does it take to
kill?&nbsp; How does it spread?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
don’t know anything about it other than those who contract it die quickly once
they begin to appear sick.&nbsp; From time to time it still claims some of our
children, we don’t know why.&nbsp; If you wish to know more about the plague
you will have to ask The Great Moll, only she will be able to answer your
questions in any more detail.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How
does she know so much about it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Because
she comes to us from the before time.&nbsp; She can remember when the plague
first struck.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn stopped dead in her tracks and turned around to face
Patricia.&nbsp; “That must be… a metaphor or something; I mean that’s not
possible.&nbsp; We lost contact with Earth six hundred years ago, how could
anyone still be around from that long ago?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It is
not a metaphor.&nbsp; She is… not like us.&nbsp; You will see.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class=MsoNormal>Chapter 14</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Patricia led Kathryn and their two male escorts along the
well-worn path towards the dam.&nbsp; Patricia had explained that this was
where the leader lived, and that she never left.&nbsp; When pressed, the woman
was unable or unwilling to explain why, merely saying with a shrug that it was
how things had always been.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Arriving at the top of the dam, they approached a heavy steel
door which was guarded by two particularly fearsome looking men who were armed
with handguns in holster at their side, rifles strung over their backs, and
holding long spears upright in their hands.&nbsp; They were resting their
weight on the spears initially, but stood stiffly at attention when they saw
Patricia’s party approach.&nbsp; She nodded at them and they stepped to the
side to allow her passage.&nbsp; Kathryn noted that they were armed with the
only firearms she had seen down here on the surface.&nbsp; She imagined that
they must have been very carefully preserved from what these people called the
ancient times and thus extraordinarily rare.&nbsp; Their use in guarding The
Great Moll, whoever that was, showed how important this figure was to
them.&nbsp; ‘They must consider it the thing most needing protection in their
lives,’ Kathryn thought to herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They group walked down many flights of stairs, Kathryn
imagined it to be about halfway down the interior of the dam.&nbsp; There were
more stairs continuing down into an unseen dark abyss below them, but they
stopped at another set of heavy watertight steel doors which were guarded by
similarly fearsome looking guards, complete with a similar arsenal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
Great Moll has standing orders for us to bring her any unusual strangers,”
Patricia explained to the guards.&nbsp; “This woman claims to come from another
planet and has clothing and weapons completely unfamiliar to us.&nbsp; I
believe The Great Moll will want to meet and assess her.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the guards nodded, opened the heavy door, and entered
beyond.&nbsp; The other guard closed the door behind him again, and stared down
Kathryn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Assess
me?” she asked Patricia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>To
determine whether you represent to us a threat, opportunity, or neither, the
woman explained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
see,” Kathryn acknowledged.&nbsp; She didn’t know if she liked the sound of
that, what would they do if they considered her a threat?&nbsp; How could she
best present herself to avoid finding out?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The heavy door opened again and the guard returned.&nbsp; He
said nothing, but his nod towards Patricia indicated their permission to
enter.&nbsp; He held the door open for all four to enter, and then closed it
behind them with a heavy bang which echoed loudly in whatever space they had
now entered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They began walking past large metal cylindrical objects
twice as tall as any of them.&nbsp; “These are the turbines which the water
spins to provide us energy,” Patricia explained.&nbsp; “There are eleven, but
only four remain operational.&nbsp; We only need one for our purposes, but we
never know which one might fail next and when, and we don’t know how to repair
them once they stop spinning.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn could tell the ones that were still working from
those which were not, they had an audible whine to them as they spun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Patricia stopped.&nbsp; “This is as far as we will go with
you.&nbsp; We will be waiting back at the door through which we entered.&nbsp;
You will find The Great Moll beyond that turbine there; your conversation is
not for our ears.” The woman began to turn and walk away, but hesitated, and
turning back to Kathryn reminded her: “Remember.&nbsp; She is… not like
us.&nbsp; Try not to be afraid.”&nbsp; She then resumed her turn and led their
two male escorts back in the direction they’d come from.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
that’s not ominous at all…” Kathryn muttered to herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a bright stream of light coming from between the
two turbines she was to find The Great Moll, which provided enough light to be
able to dimly see the entire interior of the cavernous chamber she was
in.&nbsp; Walking into the light, she saw two ridiculously brilliant lights,
and was so blinded by them that she could see little else.&nbsp; The buzzing
hum of the lights was audible over the sound of the spinning turbines nearby.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Beautiful…”
Kathryn heard a voice say.&nbsp; “Step closer,” the voice commanded and she
obliged.&nbsp; “Patricia tells me you claim to come from very far away indeed,
a different planet altogether?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s
right,” Kathryn answered.&nbsp; She had to look away: the blinding light was
growing more and more painful to look at.&nbsp; At this point she just closed
her eyes and suffered the light as a bright orange-pink glow streaming through
her eyelids.&nbsp; “The planet Haven, in the Sigma Draconis system.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After a pause, the voice asked: “New Horizon?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes!”&nbsp;
Kathryn exclaimed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>So you
really made it…” the voice said to itself.&nbsp; “We never knew.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How do
you know about the New Horizon?” Kathryn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Instead of answering the voice continued its own
interrogation.&nbsp; “How did you come back to Earth?&nbsp; It was to take you
a hundred and sixty years to get there in the first place.&nbsp; Would it not
have taken you just as long to return?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
made friends with superior technology.&nbsp; When we regained the ability to
reach orbit we were visited by humans from the planet Kobol, who-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Kobol…&nbsp;
The Mormons made it too?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes…
the Catholics as well, how do you know about all this?&nbsp; Were records left
somehow?&nbsp; If so I’d very much like to review what records you have.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Of
course you would.&nbsp; Continue. &nbsp;The Mormons have superior technology?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn was growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of
answers to her own questions, but she figured the best way to get answers for
herself later on was to be as ingratiating and forthcoming as possible right now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes.&nbsp;
They have developed a technology they call the Escher Rift.&nbsp; It harnesses
the power of a star to open portals between systems.&nbsp; They visited us
through it, and we made an arrangement for them to help us bring the New
Horizon here to solve the mystery.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
mystery?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
happened to Earth, why it went dark halfway through our trip to Haven.&nbsp; It
is the greatest mystery my people have ever known, and half of our drive to
return to the stars was to be able learn the answer.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>And
have you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Have
we what?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Solved
the mystery.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No.&nbsp;
Well, my people may have, but I’ve been out of communication with them since I
was… captured.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
see.&nbsp; Wait, you brought the New Horizon back to Earth?&nbsp; It’s here!?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A long silence.&nbsp; “I once knew a man who left on that
ship,” the voice said with a note of sentimentality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How is
that possible?” Kathryn insisted.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Because
I was there,” the voice said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn could hear a heavy switch being thrown and the
lights slowly began to fade.&nbsp; As they did she began to be able to make out
the image of her interrogator, flanked by two similar guards to those by the
doors whom she hadn’t even realized were there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The figure before her was an utterly ghastly sight.&nbsp;
She was sitting in what could only be described as a makeshift throne, with
several tall steps leading up to where she sat at shoulder level to the two
guards beside her.&nbsp; It appeared to have once been a human woman based on
what was left of the anatomy of the naked figure, but it was a body now
terribly mangled and disfigured.&nbsp; It was missing its left leg, it having
seemingly been ripped right out of the hip joint, as well as missing its right arm
just above the elbow joint.&nbsp; It had one reasonably well preserved breast,
but where the other ought to have been, instead a thick cable was attached
firmly and directly to the artificial structure beneath the skin which had
apparently been cleared away to allow the connection.&nbsp; The left side of
her face was smushed clear off, allowing various layers of anatomy to be shown,
from the relatively intact simulated human skin on the right side of her face,
to the electronic and mechanical infrastructure underneath, down to the dull
black artificial skull beneath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I was
once beautiful too,” the creature lamented.&nbsp; “I was once considered a
standard of beauty, but as you can see that was a long time ago.&nbsp; A very
long time ago.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You’re…
a simulant.” Kathryn uttered with dawning understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
know what a simulant is?” it asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes.&nbsp;
My people’s civilization was founded by four simulants of the New Horizon
mission’s principle founders.&nbsp; They… they saved us from ourselves when we
first arrived at Haven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I see.&nbsp;
I’d like to know more about that when the time comes.&nbsp; Yes, Kathryn.&nbsp;
I am a simulant as well, perhaps the very last one in existence.&nbsp; I was
once known as a Molly, a conscious sex toy for men who indulged in such
things.&nbsp; One of my… clients back in those days was a man who left on the
New Horizon mission.&nbsp; I remember that many if not most of the men who
availed themselves of me were unscrupulous if not loathsome, but Markus… we had
a moment before he left, a moment which led me to grow beyond my original
programming and seek an independent life of my own.&nbsp; I’ll never forget
him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn was aghast.&nbsp; “Markus… Bowland??</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Molly smiled.&nbsp; “Yes, why?&nbsp; What became of him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn cringed.&nbsp; “A story for another time I
suspect.&nbsp; Sufficive to say, he was ultimately the reason why the founder
simulants needed to save us from ourselves.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
see,” Molly acknowledged with a frown.&nbsp; If true this wouldn’t surprise her
but more important things were at hand.&nbsp; “Do the Catholics or Mormons have
simulant technology?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m
afraid not,” Kathryn answered.&nbsp; The simulant appeared quite disappointed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
bargain did you make for them to bring you here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>When
both of the other colony ships left,” Kathryn explained, “they purged
themselves of Earth’s history.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
remember,” Molly said with a nod.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>But
the New Horizon kept a full and complete archive, backed up by a physical
medium which is still intact to this day.&nbsp; We agreed to grant them access
to the archive in exchange for use of their portal system and upgrades to the
New Horizon which allowed us to come here ourselves.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>And
now you’re here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes.&nbsp;
And now that we’ve met you, you can fill us in on everything that happened
since the last transmission New Horizon received from Earth on its way to
Haven!” Kathryn excitedly exclaimed.&nbsp; She’d never imagined such a thing
would be possible, simulants weren’t supposed to last that long.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
certainly could.&nbsp; But I won’t.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn’s optimism visibly melted away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Not
for free anyways,” Molly continued.&nbsp; “It seems from your story that
information, history, is itself the most valuable commodity in the universe
now.&nbsp; I’m not going to just give away my only currency.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Currency?&nbsp;
What are you hoping to purchase from us Molly?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Freedom…”
Molly answered quietly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
don’t understand,” Kathryn admitted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Some
of my components have survived,” she explained, “but others have not.&nbsp; My
quantum brain for example,” she said with a gesture of her remaining hand in
the direction of her head, “is still in quite good condition which is why I can
talk to you and tell you all the history you could possibly want to know.&nbsp;
My internal fusion reactor on the other hand…” gesturing towards where her
right breast used to be, “failed nearly two centuries ago now.&nbsp; I have been
tethered to these turbines ever since.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
haven’t been able to leave this room since?” Kathryn asked somewhat aghast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I have
not seen the sun in one hundred and eighty seven years.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m
sorry.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Molly looked down and away with one misty eye.&nbsp; “So it
goes,” she replied with a sad expression.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
would help you any way we can with or without anything in exchange Molly.&nbsp;
You’re precious, you are… unique.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s
a nice sentiment child, but with my existence at stake I can’t take any
chances.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn nodded.&nbsp; “What do you want us to do?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Repair
me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
fusion technology appears to be child’s play to the Mormons so I imagine
they’ll be able to help you out with that at least.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Excellent.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>But
like I said, none of us have developed simulant technology so we wouldn’t know
where to start in repairing your body.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>In
maintaining myself, I learned a great deal about simulant construction and
repair.&nbsp; There are abandoned simulant manufacturing facilities all over
the world, but I have not been able to go in search of them since I have been
trapped here.&nbsp; The scavenging parties I send out don’t really know what to
look for either but you and your people could find what I need, I’m sure of it.&nbsp;
Ideally I want a new and intact Molly model which my program could be
transferred into, but I would honestly settle for any intact simulant body to
be transferred into.&nbsp; Oh hell…” the woman lamented looking at her missing
leg.&nbsp; “Who am I kidding?&nbsp; To tell you the truth I’d settle for a
mismatched replacement arm and leg and tell you everything you want to know.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
will do what we can to help you, I promise,” Kathryn assured her, “but you must
let me talk to my friends, they must be so worried about me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Of course.&nbsp;
I assume you have this scroll connected to a communications network?” Molly
asked as she held up Kathryn’s scroll.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Then
here, take it,” she said as she tossed it to Kathryn, who fumbled with it a bit
and nearly dropped it before securing it in her hands.&nbsp; “They are welcome
to come and meet me as well.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class=MsoNormal>Chapter 15</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under the watchful eye of her guards Kathryn approached and
took the scroll from Molly.&nbsp; She unfurled it and tapped out a comm request
up to the New Horizon.&nbsp; Jaren’s face immediately appeared.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Kathryn!”
Jaren’s face on the screen uttered.&nbsp; “Oh thank the lord, are you alright?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
Jaren, I’m fine, everything’s fine…&nbsp; In fact, I’ve made a new friend who
would like to meet you.&nbsp; She’s made us an offer which I think you and Teresa
are definitely going to want to hear.&nbsp; If you two agree to come down and
discuss it with us I will then be free to leave with you again.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren’s eyes narrowed slightly in suspicion.&nbsp; “Or we
will be two additional valuable hostages.&nbsp; It’s what they did to you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
men can be savages,” Molly said loudly enough for Jaren to hear.&nbsp; “But I
will personally guarantee your safety and free passage.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Who
was that?” Jaren asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,”
Kathryn said looking back at her momentarily, “our new friend,” she answered
optimistically.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren looked to the side at someone off screen and nodded
before sighing in resignation.&nbsp; “Very well.&nbsp; We’ll come down right
now.&nbsp; We’ll bring the cure for you as well while we’re at it, the sooner
we can treat you the better.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Cure?”
Kathryn asked with renewed concern, remembering what he’d called out to them
during their botched rescue attempt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
that’s what I was trying to tell you.&nbsp; It was a plague Kathryn, that’s
what wiped out Earth.&nbsp; The people down there now are just the descendants
of those who happened to have a natural immunity.&nbsp; You don’t though.&nbsp;
We were all infected.&nbsp; New Horizon’s medical tubes couldn’t detect it but
Koboli tech could, and Nadelle was able to create a cure.&nbsp; Untreated you
only have a few days left until you would die from it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn looked at Molly, who nodded both gravely and
knowingly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Very
well,” Kathryn acknowledged.&nbsp; “I’ll meet you at the main entrance to the
dam.&nbsp; You can land just beyond it and I’ll show you down here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We’ll
be there in twenty minutes.&nbsp; See you soon.”&nbsp; He hastily closed the
channel, presumably to be able to come see her as soon as possible without
wasting any moments in between.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>He
loves you,” Molly stated matter-of-factly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,”
Kathryn said with a smile to herself.&nbsp; “You could tell?” she asked,
looking up at her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I was
designed to be an expert.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Of
course,” Kathryn acknowledged with a stifled laugh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Molly pressed a button on a panel on the arm rest of her
chair where she was missing an arm.&nbsp; “Patricia,” was all she said.&nbsp;
Kathryn heard the clanging of the heavy door and not long after Patricia came
into view and joined them.&nbsp; “You have served me well bringing this one to
me.&nbsp; She is to be treated as an honoured guest, as are her friends who
will be landing and joining her shortly.&nbsp; Please escort Kathryn to the top
of the dam to greet her friends with her.&nbsp; You will then bring them all
down to meet me, and clearly instruct the men to not interfere.&nbsp; Do you
understand?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
Leader,” Patricia answered with a slight bow.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Good.&nbsp;
Go on then.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As instructed, Patricia led Kathryn and her two male escorts
up the stairs again to the top of the dam and over to the nearby
clearing.&nbsp; Not long after they saw Jaren’s ship high up in the sky rapidly
descending towards them, and then dramatically reduce its velocity as it
approached the ground, coming to a near stop just above the ground, and then
softly touching down.&nbsp; The door wall fell away to form a ramp, and Jaren
fearlessly emerged, walked quickly over to Kathryn and embraced her so tightly
that her eyes widened and it momentarily became a difficult for Kathryn to
breathe.&nbsp; He let up enough for her be able to do so, but still held her
quite tightly still, rocking with her sideways back and forth for a long
lingering moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Thank
the lord you’re safe,” he said quietly in her ear.&nbsp; “I was so worried
about you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I know
Jaren,” she said as she set him a distance from her with her hand son his upper
arms.&nbsp; “I know, but I’m fine, everything’s fine now,” she said with a
smile as she put a hand to his cheek.&nbsp; “And I’ve made a wonderful
discovery!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While Jaren got himself acquainted with the idea that all
really was well now, Kathryn noticed Teresa and Felix approach from behind
him.&nbsp; As soon as Jaren gave way Felix immediately subbed in and gave her a
big bear hug, lifting her up off of the ground and twirling her around.&nbsp;
“Way to still be alive, kid,” he said in a teasing tone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When he set her back down on the ground, Jaren pulled a
transdermic out of his pocket and held it to her arm.&nbsp; A small plastic
bell created a suction in the void abover her skin into which a skin dilating
vapour was emitted, permitting the cure for the plague to be readily absorbed
into her bloodstream when it was secondly released into the void.&nbsp; The
whole process took only a few seconds before he pulled the device away and she
rubbed the spot for a moment as Teresa put her hand on her shoulder and smiled
an appreciative smile, saying simply: “It’s good to see you again,
Captain.”&nbsp; Kathryn nodded in acknowledgement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Judging
from how things went when we first met, I’m guessing this isn’t your new
friend?” Jaren said with a motion of his head towards Patricia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No,
but she works for her,” Kathryn explained.&nbsp; “She’s a simulant Jaren, a
sexim actually,” Kathryn added as she momentarily looked over at the dam.&nbsp;
“She’s very likely the last functioning simulant in existence, and… only barely
still functioning at that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What’s
a simulant?” Teresa asked.&nbsp; The moderately confused look on Jaren’s face
signalled his own lack of understanding as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh.&nbsp;
I guess you wouldn’t have any records of them would you?&nbsp; Well, simulants
were synthetic humans constructed on Earth during the era our missions
left.&nbsp; They were designed to be completely indistinguishable from humans,
and when the New Horizon mission departed they’d reached that level quite
completely.&nbsp; Some were constructed based on real living people, and others
were novel units designed from scratch.&nbsp; The founders of Haven colony, the
most revered figures in our history, were simulants of the four original
principle mission founders.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I had
no idea…” Jaren said with obvious uncertainty.&nbsp; Still, the implications
became quite clear to him.&nbsp; “Wait, so you’re saying that down in that dam,
the voice I heard on your scroll, is a six hundred year old artificial human?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes!&nbsp;
Well, probably a bit older actually…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s…
perverse,” he remarked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
do you mean?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>To try
to duplicate God’s highest creation, I… I don’t know how I feel about that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn gave him a curious look.&nbsp; She knew that he came
from a religious planet, but she’d never been confronted with this side of him
before.&nbsp; She chose to believe that it was more of a reflexive response to
this new revelation, and that with time his better sense would win over, and
she knew she would be happy to help him if he needed a little reassurance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
you’ll have plenty of time to ponder the metaphysics later.&nbsp; In the mean
time you’re going to meet her.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the group made their way into the dam past the guards and
down the stairwell, Kathryn explained that Molly’s body had severely degraded
over time.&nbsp; She explained her demands in exchange for telling them
everything she could tell them about what happened to Earth since the last time
New Horizon’s physical archive was updated on the way to Haven.&nbsp; It would
help that the archive on the New Horizon was nearly sixty percent updated from
Kobol at this point, and advancing every twelve hours as updates were transmitted
through the rift.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren immediately understood the importance of this
opportunity and put whatever reservations he had about the concept of an
artificial human being itself aside for the time being.&nbsp; They passed the
second set of guards and entered the turbine room.&nbsp; Despite the clear
warnings of her appearance from Kathryn, Jaren, Felix, and Teresa were all
visibly taken aback when she came into view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Did
you tell them I used to be beautiful?” Molly asked Kathryn, betraying her
vulnerable sensitivity to her appearance in front of her new visitors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes I
did Molly, they know.&nbsp; And they’ve agreed to do whatever they can to help
restore you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Molly nodded to Patricia and the young woman retreated once
more with their escorts.&nbsp; The two male guards on either side of Molly’s
throne remained though.&nbsp; Jaren and Teresa stepped forward to greet
Molly.&nbsp; “As official representatives of the planets Kobol and Roma,”
Teresa opened, “we offer you greetings, and graciously accept your kind offer
of friendship and cooperation.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Good…”
Molly acknowledged with a nod.&nbsp; “Good.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Felix stepped forward, but his head was down looking at the
screen of his scroll.&nbsp; “It looks like there is supposed to be detailed
data in New Horizon’s archives regarding the construction and maintenance of
simulants,” Felix offered.&nbsp; “A quick scan turned up fragmentary
information, which suggests more complete information we haven’t received
yet.&nbsp; Next chance I get I’ll request the Koboli recovery team to
prioritize data on simulants in any way they can.”&nbsp; He looked up at
Molly.&nbsp; “Even so though, the required technical expertise is… beyond any
of us,” he admitted, waving the scroll towards Jaren and then Teresa.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
understand,” Molly said, “but with time… if I had an appropriate laboratory and
enough technical details, I could learn to do the work for myself, or
adequately instruct others in what I cannot do for myself.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>As for
your internal fusion core,” Jaren said, rubbing his chin, now seemingly more
invested in the technical puzzle confronting him than any lingering concerns
regarding her existence at all, “we don’t have anything off of the shelf on
Kobol which would be appropriate to the job, but with the relevant
specifications from New Horizon’s archive regarding dimensions, capacity, output,
and a good look at your original defective unit… I have no doubts at all that
we’d will be able to replicate an appropriate micro core for you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Excellent!”
Molly’s expression so visibly brightened at this news that her excitement was
contagious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>In the
meantime,” he continued, “we brought with us to Earth a number of anti-matter
batteries which could probably be used as an external but relatively portable
power source for you right away.&nbsp; Even one of batteries we used getting
some of Orbital One’s systems up and running again would probably have enough
power left in it to keep you going for several years at least.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Orbital
One?” Molly marvelled, “you’ve been there?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,”
Teresa answered matter of factly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
remember it well,” Molly recounted, seemingly overcome with nostalgia.&nbsp; “I
remember when Orbital Two came down.&nbsp; Those were… dark years, literally,”
she remarked with a raise of her one remaining eyebrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>As for
your… body,” Jaren said, struggling through a touch of awkwardness in the
required phrasing.&nbsp; “We have no immediate way to help you, I’m
afraid.&nbsp; We don’t know anything about how you work or how to construct
anything like you.&nbsp; With your help though, and with years or even decades
of study of… what’s left of you, we may be able to create a rudimentary
replacement for your limbs, but… I suspect anything more sophisticated would
take several decades or more of dedicated research, even with detailed data
from New Horizon’s archives.&nbsp; Plus…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What?”
Molly asked, sensing his hesitation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Such research,
on my world, could create some… political tensions.&nbsp; Religion is still a
very significant force on my world, and there are many who would object to such
a project.&nbsp; We also are currently led by a president who is not known for
taking actions which could be potentially politically damaging.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
see.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Haven
technology is… well, simple by comparison to the Romans and Koboli,” Felix
admitted to Molly,” but we would relish the opportunity to study you and do
anything we could to help you restore yourself.&nbsp; It would take us much
longer to get up to speed but, well… we revere our simulant founders as, well
not gods per se, but certainly regard them in something approximating a
mythical sort of way.&nbsp; Restoring you would for us be a labour of love and
respect.&nbsp; We would cherish the opportunity.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>And
yet,” Molly replied, “if it could take them decades it could easily take you a
century.&nbsp; There may however be an intermediary measure which would suit me
even better.&nbsp; On the coast to the south lay the ruins of a once great
city, a place once known as Vancouver.&nbsp; Somewhere in what is left of that
city lay the remains of the laboratory where I was created so long ago.&nbsp;
While there is no chance of there just happening to be an intact Molly unit
just waiting there for me, there may still be intact replacement parts such as
arms and legs.&nbsp; If we were extraordinarily lucky there may even be an
abandoned yet nearly complete simulant body which I could be moved into with
some work, but this is likely just too much to dare hope for.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>If we
provide you with a new power source,” Kathryn asked, “and make every effort to
find these spare parts for you, but we can’t and promise to conduct all the
required research and development to fully restore you eventually, will you
promise to provide us with all of the history you know?&nbsp; If we commit to
doing the research as long as it takes to be able to honour our agreement?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Molly considered the question carefully.&nbsp; “If you
provide me with a new power supply in short order, and make the attempt to
restore me now, if… you will bring me the sun again, I will provide you with
the most essential details.&nbsp; The full recounting of everything I know, my
full recollection and legacy though, will be withheld until I am adequately
restored, or until I feel I can trust you enough to be assured that you will
continue your efforts to help me regardless.&nbsp; Is this acceptable to you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn, Jaren, and Teresa looked at each other and all
nodded.&nbsp; “It is, Molly.” Kathryn stated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Outstanding,”
Molly said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
should be able to get our other shuttle to extract the power cell from Orbital
One and get it down here within an hour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>True to his word, less than an hour later Irvina had ordered
a fresh battery installed into Orbital One, and had personally brought the used
one down to Jaren, accompanied by Francis, who stayed behind with the surface
team in case with his engineering expertise might be required to help the
others connect it to Molly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Now
one way or another, with no battery backup your systems are going to lose power
when we switch you over from the local power supply to this battery,” Jaren
explained.&nbsp; “What will happen when that happens?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I will
appear to die,” she explained, “but when power has been restored I should
finish rebooting after a few minutes.&nbsp; “If not you will need to hard boot
me by pinching hard the skin between my thumb and finger and pressing any of my
molar teeth.&nbsp; It is also possible to do so by tinkering with my brain
case, but I’d quite prefer you didn’t do that if you don’t know what you’re
doing.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Perfectly
understandable,” Jaren said with his usual friendly smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Molly, not charmed one bit, warned him: “you should know
though, that if I don’t wake up, the guards here will believe that you have
killed me, and they will take swift vengeance on you. &nbsp;No matter what I
might tell them ahead of time, you would not make it out of this room alive.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His smile dissipated, Jaren nodded that he understood.&nbsp;
Molly provided him with the exact voltage and amperage her body required, and
told them where nearby they could find a plug which matched the inverse
connector on her chest.&nbsp; They were able to connect the plug to the power
source and dial in the exact energy dimensions as Kathryn and Teresa watched
on, and then informed her she was ready.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Go
ahead,” Molly said seriously with a lowered head and eyes glaring forward into
space.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren and Felix lifted the half meter long battery onto her
lap, and held their breath as Jaren unplugged her existing power supply.&nbsp;
Her gritted look forward gave way to a complete absence of any kind of
expression whatsoever as the life literally drained out of her.&nbsp; Jaren
then carefully plugged in the new power source and everyone held their
breath.&nbsp; Nothing happened for almost two minutes, and as the guards began
to murmur to themselves, Jaren began considering attempting the hard boot up
process she had described to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As he considered this, her eye bolted wide open and she sat
up as she gasped deeply.&nbsp; The suddenness of her revival caused Jaren,
Felix, and Francis all to jump back over a meter in fright, making Kathryn and
Teresa laugh at their reaction.&nbsp; Molly seemed to regain her composure, and
when she realized what had been done, and that it had been successful, she
thanked them and assured them that it had worked perfectly.&nbsp; A plethora of
wide grins and congratulatory handshakes ensued as Molly looked down at her new
portable life line.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Years
you say?” she asked Jaren.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s
right,” he assured you.&nbsp; “Congratulations.&nbsp; Like I said, by the time
that wears out, we’ll have designed a replacement internal unit for you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Thank
you,” she said simply.&nbsp; “I’d like to see the sun now,” she said with an
emotional note in her voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Her guards lifted her and the battery in her lap up and put
her in a chair in which they could more easily carry her.&nbsp; With the
expedition team members following behind, they carried her over to the door,
and Patricia, her escorts, as well as the door guards, all joined the parade
behind her as they ascended the stairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the upper door opened, and natural sunlight fell on
Molly, she began openly weeping out of her one large brown eye.&nbsp; Her
guards set her down on the grass in the full glory of the late afternoon sun,
and all of the rest of them let her be for some time as she continued to sob
with the intensity of her relief.&nbsp; She had been trapped down in her
dungeon for so long, and now to be free, after having no hope of ever being so
only days ago, was too much for her to keep contained.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She had never been a natural leader.&nbsp; Confident sure,
capable certainly, but the burden of leading these people and being responsible
for their survival and safety for so long had been so much for her to bear,
especially from down there in her lonely depths.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Patricia,”
she managed to croak.&nbsp; The young woman knelt down in front of her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I am
very happy for you Leader, this is a great day is it not?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It is
child, it is… take me to the village.&nbsp; Tonight there will be a great feast
to honour our guests and new friends, spare no luxury we have to offer, both
the finest goods we have scavenged and created for ourselves, understand?&nbsp;
This is a day to be remembered for generations.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes
Leader,” the woman said, now becoming overcome with emotion herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
noble travellers have come home, and they have pledged to help us.&nbsp; It is
a reunion, child.&nbsp; Our family has finally been put back together.&nbsp; We
have a future again.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
Leader.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>True to her word, the celebration was beyond anything the
villagers had ever known in their lives.&nbsp; Not only were the reserves of
their locally produced alcohol and cannabis nearly entirely depleted, but later
in the evening they’d even broken into the especially sacred store of wine from
the before time.&nbsp; They laughed and giggled to themselves opening six
hundred year old bottles of wine.&nbsp; Some were rancid, some were vinegar,
but some were remarkably drinkable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a gigantic central bonfire resulting from a pyre
twice the height of a person, and the villagers spent most of the night taking
turns dancing around it sometimes in wild unstructured enthusiasm, others in
attempting to replicate the ceremonial dances their elders had passed down to
them.&nbsp; There were other smaller fires nearby as well, fires more amenable
to roasting full deer, fish, and goose, or merely for gathering around conversationally.&nbsp;
Molly and the New Horizon crew on the surface were gathered around just such a
fire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren sat down very close to Molly under the watchful eye of
her personal guards, in order to speak with her in relative privacy.&nbsp;
Kathryn watched him do so, but could hear none of the exchange.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
don’t like me, do you?” he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
don’t like men,” Molly answered matter-of-factly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
see.&nbsp; Because of your… origins.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s
right,” Molly answered carefully, and after a moment’s hesitation.&nbsp; “You
don’t like me much either do you?” she asked him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
wouldn’t characterize it in quite that way.&nbsp; I find your existence…
disquieting, a disruption to my view of myself.&nbsp; It is nothing to do with
you personally though, encountering any simulant would have elicited a similar
reaction.&nbsp; Likewise I suspect with me being any unfamiliar man to you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Hmm…”
Margaret responded thoughtfully but still somewhat dismissively as she took a
drink from her cup.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Tell
me…” he asked thoughtfully, “can you come to trust a man?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Molly shrugged.&nbsp; “It’s been known to happen…
sometimes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Then I
shall endeavour to do whatever I can to foster your trust in me.&nbsp; I wish
us to be allies, friends…&nbsp; I want you to trust that even if you had
nothing to provide us, we would do whatever we could to help you regardless.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Why?&nbsp;
I find that hard to believe.&nbsp; Everything in human interaction is an
exchange.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren sighed and leaned back, staring into the fire.&nbsp;
“I’m going to be honest Molly, when I first learned of your existence… I was
not just disquieted, I was utterly aghast.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She looked at him curiously with her one large brown
eye.&nbsp; “Why?” she asked.&nbsp; If one could focus on the parts of her that
were still intact, one could still see how achingly beautiful she must have
indeed once been.&nbsp; Her eye was large to the point that she appeared
wide-eyed while looking casually, and her most casual gaze always seemed to be
staring into the deepest depths of one’s soul with compassion and sympathy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>My
people have come a long way since we originally left Earth, our religion is
more a… figure of speech at this point, something few take too seriously
despite our habit of speaking and acting as though we still do take it very
seriously.&nbsp; The deep parts of me that firmly internalized the religious
teachings of my youth cried when I found out about you.&nbsp; We had forgotten
that simulants ever existed, we brought no records of their existence, and
after generations of it never coming up, we had completely forgotten.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
idea of a perfectly simulated human being seemed to be… a direct challenge to
God itself.&nbsp; If nothing else, it is God who creates people, if not their
bodies then their… well, soul for lack of a better world.&nbsp; If humans can
create something indistinguishable from a human being, something so close an approximation
that we would assume it had a… soul, to meet them and never be informed of
their artificiality, I guess if felt like there was no space left for God at
all in the genesis of a person.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Maybe
that’s something to think about,” Molly offered matter of factly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It
is,” Jaren agreed thoughtfully, “and I have been, believe me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There were several moments of silence as they stared into
the licking orange flames together, seeing their whole lives in flashes dancing
in the image of the flames reflecting in their eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
more I think about it though?&nbsp; The more…” Jaren trailed off.&nbsp; “See,
my people are so technologically advanced compared to the others because we
consider technological advancement to be a primary commandment from God.&nbsp;
From the very beginning the goal was always to strive to become ever more
godlike in our morality and behaviour, and at some point after landing on Kobol
we re-interpreted that into an imperative to become ever more god like in our
technological powers as well.&nbsp; We sought to build ever more powerful
tools, but we never once thought about attempting to duplicate God’s powers of
human creation, the power which was obviously generated to create you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He and Molly were still staring into the fire, and she found
herself quite interested in what he had to say.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>My
people had to be coerced into coming here by the other colonies.&nbsp; They had
no interest in Earth because we detected no technology here we could learn
from.&nbsp; That has changed now.&nbsp; After my initial shock at your existence,
I realize not that even if we never choose to construct fully fledged simulants
ourselves, our understanding of your construction and function would be a vast
leap for us in any number of areas.&nbsp; The discovery of you I believe will
if nothing else mean that my people will be more interested in Earth now,
intrigued by what they can learn and what powers they can newly harness from
understanding you and your kind.&nbsp; So yes, we all want to know everything
you can tell us about the history of Earth from the time New Horizon left to
the present, but my people especially will want to help you restore yourself
regardless of that because of what they can learn technologically from helping
you so.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
understand,” Molly said with a nod.&nbsp; “You haven’t earned my trust yet
Mormon, but you might’ve opened a door.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren smiled and a puff of air escaped through his nose as
his smile was accompanied by the hint of a laugh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sensing that whatever they were talking about was abated for
the time being, Kathryn came around the fire over to them and sat on the other
side of Molly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Molly,
we know from our orbital observations that there are a number of small
encampments like this one spread all over the world.&nbsp; Do you ever come
into contact with them?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Not
directly, no.&nbsp; Our most frequent interactions are when our scavenging
parties come across those from another village in the ruins of an ancient
city.&nbsp; More often than not violence ensues, but what else would you
expect, they are all men after all.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn wrinkled her brow at this generalization.&nbsp; “I
see, so how do you think the others would react to coming across us?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
don’t know,” Molly admitted, “I’ve been locked in that dam for the better part
of two centuries, and when the scavenging parties return they have little more
to offer than casualty reports.&nbsp; You probably know more about them than I
do just from your ability to observe from orbit.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
know Jaren,” Kathryn said past Molly, “I was thinking, so much has happened so
far, it would probably be wise to check in with our home worlds before
launching any expeditions south, offer them an update on our progress and what
not.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You’re
probably right,” Jaren agreed, “of course there’s always the possibility that
for whatever reason we might be told not to engage in that mission and return
home instead.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn grinned.&nbsp; “I think there would suddenly be some
inexplicable communications interference if they tried to issue that
order.&nbsp; It’s a damn how things like that can happen at the most
inopportune time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren laughed.&nbsp; “Quite true.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Besides,”
Kathryn continued, “I find that quite unlikely, at least from my people.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren nodded that he probably felt the same way about his
own command higher ups.&nbsp; In his experience they tended let their people
take whatever risks those on the ground felt it appropriate and worthwhile to
take.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>So
Molly,” Kathryn said, turning to what was left of the simulant.&nbsp; “What are
you willing to tell us about what happened to Earth?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The simulated woman took another drink from her tin cup and
took a deep breath.&nbsp; “Well, you’re right of course, that there was a
plague.&nbsp; Nobody knew where it had come from or how it had been created,
there… was simply no time.&nbsp; People seemed fine for a week after being
infected, and then suddenly dropped dead the next day.&nbsp; Billions, and
billions… and billions,” her eye revealed her to be lost in unpleasant
remembrance.&nbsp; “Have you ever walked the streets of a city of twenty
million corpses?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn and Jaren just looked at each other with a shiver up
their spines.&nbsp; Sensing that it was story time, the rest of the New Horizon
crew and some locals gathered up near her to hear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Everyone
who was going to die… everyone on Earth anyways, died within a week of the
first death.&nbsp; There was no time for civilization to break down, instead it
just ended… midsentence.&nbsp; For quite some time we simulants thought we were
the only survivors.&nbsp; Our programming is designed to recognize infectious
agents and simulate the effects on us.&nbsp; Our deaths are only simulated and
unlike the humans we can be reactivated, but this disease… it was designed to
be undetectable to modern medicine and… as such it went unnoticed by our
systems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
thought maybe we were the only survivors, and for a time we contemplated how
empty and shallow a fate that would be, we who could not reproduce, we who did
not know how to create more of ourselves.&nbsp; We would wander the Earth in
dwindling numbers until finally the last of us inevitably went offline.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>But
then, a miracle happened.&nbsp; We came across humans, survivors.&nbsp; At
first we thought maybe they were just simulants who had gone mad and come to
believe themselves humans but no, honest to goodness flesh and blood human
beings.&nbsp; We cherished them as the miracles they were.&nbsp; We tried to
lead them, tried to gather them up in one place and rebuild what we could of a
civilization, but… supplies were limited.&nbsp; Our whole food supply chain had
become so technological that specialized technicians were required to generate
everything from lettuce to meat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>After
the first riotous frenzy of hostility and outbreak of murders, theft, and
hoarding… we realized that what we had hoped for would be impossible.&nbsp; My
husband and I gathered up our descendants and others and headed here.&nbsp; We
had a lot more technology left over back in those days, but energy to power
them was a scarce resource.&nbsp; Dams such as this one were one of the few
remaining reliable sources of power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Some
other simulants did the same and-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m
sorry to interrupt,” Felix apologetically interjected, “but you had a husband
and… descendants?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,”
she answered nostalgically.&nbsp; “His name was Colin.&nbsp; He was a
simulation of an Australian man who ran a casino and bar on Orbital One.&nbsp;
He died several hundred years ago falling from a great height and damaging his
brain beyond repair… there was nothing we could do.&nbsp; Long before that
though, we were the first simulants in history to commission a human child of
our own out of sorrow at our own inability to reproduce but, well… that’s a
story for another time.&nbsp; And yes, some of the people here are descendants
of that child, like Patricia over there.” Molly pointed to Patricia over at the
main fire, who noticed and smiled back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The New Horizon crew all nodded a new understanding of the
relationship between the two.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Does
she know?” Kathryn asked her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No,
she… she wouldn’t understand.” Molly answered.&nbsp; “That’s really all there
is to tell.&nbsp; We made a life here as best we could.&nbsp; We still
scavenged what we could find, there are old small towns near here, but it
wasn’t long before we’d scavenged everything we could form those places and had
to mount ever more dangerous expeditions south to the ruins of Vancouver.&nbsp;
We had to learn from scratch how to farm, how to keep animals, how to build
shelters, all the things which were completely unknown to us as pampered high
tech city dwellers.&nbsp; We had some very rough years and lost a lot of really
good people, but… we came through in the end as you can see.&nbsp; I’d like to
think we are thriving, all things considered.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
became of the other simulants?” Jaren asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
kept in contact for some time,” Molly explained.&nbsp; “We were a network of
saviours for the remaining humans, sharing what information we could about what
we’d found and newly learned and discovered.&nbsp; One by one though… they
stopped answering my comm requests, either they broke down or their comm
devices did.&nbsp; The last I was still in contact with though I never heard
from again after the Years of the Falling Sky.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
is that?” Kathryn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh,
it’s an era we survived and still reference.&nbsp; A century after the Plague
struck, all of the larger things in orbit started falling down on us.&nbsp; The
most catastrophic event was when Orbital Two fell down and hit the lands to the
far East of here.&nbsp; After that critical communications relay crashed down, I
never heard from another simulant ever again.&nbsp; That was four hundred years
ago.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>So
it’s possible that some other simulants have survived,” Felix observed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Possible
yes,” Molly conceded, “but the odds are quite against even my own survival… I
shouldn’t even still be around.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Can
you tell us more about what happened before the plague?” Teresa asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No,”
Molly answered matter-of-factly.&nbsp; “I increasingly trust you people but I’m
not ready to play all of my cards at once here.&nbsp; Besides, the night grows
late.”&nbsp; She looked over to the main fire and saw that half of her people
had collapsed in exhaustion or from too much drink or smoke in the now
twilight.&nbsp; “My people have prepared beds for you to spend the night with
us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>With…
all due respect,” Jaren offered diplomatically, “we should really be get-”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
he means,” Kathryn said, cutting him off, “is that we would be honoured to be
your guests tonight.&nbsp; In the morning we will return to our ship and report
our progress to our home worlds through the rift.&nbsp; Molly, you’re… welcome
to join us on the ship while we do so, if you’d like.”&nbsp; She wasn’t sure
how she’d feel about the offer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I… I
haven’t been to orbit in six hundred years.&nbsp; I’m torn,” she admitted, “by
my desire to get as far away from my prison as possible, and… my reluctance to
abandon my people.&nbsp; Thank you Kathryn, I may take you up on the offer but
I think I need the night to sleep on it.&nbsp; Patricia!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The young woman in the flower print dress came over from the
main fire to see what Molly wanted of her.&nbsp; Please show our guests to the
beds we’ve prepared for them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Patricia simply nodded and held out her hand to lead
them.&nbsp; The New Horizon crew lifted themselves up onto their feet and
followed her to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They didn’t get much sleep that night, not only were the beds
somewhat uncomfortable, but their thoughts were consumed with the nightmare
story Molly had described for them.&nbsp; It was a story about the end of all
things, a thing feared in very primal parts of their deep human psyche.&nbsp;
Every one of them when they did finally fall asleep suffered at least once
being the last being alive in a city of twenty million corpses, desperately,
frantically searching for another living being to assure them against their
absolute loneliness, but finding none. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class=MsoNormal>Chapter 16</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next morning, the New Horizon crew walked the path over
to the shuttle accompanied by Molly, still carried in a chair by her two guards
with her power cell in her lap.&nbsp; She had been assured that she was welcome
to bring her guards with her up to the ship, but she waved them away when it
came time to board the ship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Patricia had accompanied them to the shuttle.&nbsp; When it
came time to board the vessel, Molly turned to Patricia with a thoughtful look.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>My
dear I was going to leave you in charge in our absence, but now I wonder… would
you like to come with us?&nbsp; It would be the opportunity of a lifetime for
you, and,” she looked over at the guards, “it might put the others more at ease
with my going if you accompanied me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Leader,
I… I don’t know what to say.&nbsp; To ascend to the sky, is… I never dared to
dream.&nbsp; I would be honoured,” she replied with a gesture which was
something between a bow and a curtsy, pulling the sides of her dress out as she
lowered her head respectfully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Tell
the others,” Molly said to her guards, “that Vega shall be in charge until I
return.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They nodded their understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>May we
borrow one of your scrolls?” Molly asked Kathryn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Of
course,” she answered as Jaren lowered the shuttle door with a point of his
wand.&nbsp; She pulled her own personal scroll out of her pocket and handed it
to Molly, who then handed it to one of her guards. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You’ll
be able to contact me at any time using this.&nbsp; Do not be afraid.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes
Leader,” one of the guards finally answered.&nbsp; “Safe journey.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Molly nodded and Jaren, Felix, Kathryn, and Teresa all
together lifted Molly’s chair and carried her up the ramp.&nbsp; Patricia
followed behind in a combination of apprehension and wonderment over the
ship.&nbsp; She had never seen anything like it.&nbsp; Neither had Molly for
that matter, but she was harder to impress having seen all of the wonders Earth
had to offer before the plague.&nbsp; Patricia had never seen anything more
sophisticated than the dam and the trinkets the scavengers had managed to bring
back with them.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What impressed her most was the seeming transparency of the
walls, how once inside there seemed to be a clear view to the outside through
the interior walls, with the exception of one large wall panel which was
clearly and thoroughly cracked and not functioning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Patricia and Kathryn lifted Molly out of her chair and into
one of the seats which ringed the interior of the shuttle.&nbsp; They strapped
her in and then proceeded to do the same for themselves.&nbsp; Jaren handed the
chair to Molly’s guards outside, telling them that they’d figure something else
out on the other end.&nbsp; He then re-entered the shuttle and after warning
everyone, launched the ship up into the air and into orbit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The shuttle was capable of travelling much faster than could
be comfortably tolerated by its passengers, and even the three gees at which he
capped their acceleration was somewhat uncomfortable to endure for the ten
minutes it took them to catch up with New Horizon’s orbital velocity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Catching up with the ship he carefully docked and informed
everyone that they were secure and free to remove their restraints.&nbsp; The
lack of gravity in the central engineering section of the ship was remarkably
freeing for Molly who now with her one arm and one leg could manoeuver reasonably
effectively on her own, though was still assisted by Patricia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’d
like to show Molly and Patricia the bubble,” Kathryn informed the others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren and Teresa said that they would proceed to the bridge
and begin configuring the comm and rift systems for sending a message back to
their planets, and that when Kathryn was ready she could have a turn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>When
you’re ready to bring them up, we’ll have to figure out some sort of rope and
harness system to get her safely down to the habitat ring,” Jaren realized.&nbsp;
“We’ll figure it out, you just let us know when you’re done in the bubble.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Patricia, never having experienced microgravity before, had
the typical problems and unforced errors of any novice, such as the instinctual
impulse to attempt to swim.&nbsp; This was so common because the closest analog
to the sensation of weightlessness on Earth was the neutral buoyancy of being
in water.&nbsp; But before long she figured out appropriate usage of the foot
and hand holds and followed along behind Kathryn and Molly towards the forward
engineering section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>This
is our fusion core,” Kathryn informed them as they passed the central core
section on their way to the bubble.&nbsp; It is a much larger and more powerful
version of what originally powered you.&nbsp; Molly understood this immediately
upon hearing it was a fusion reactor, so the information was largely for
Patricia’s benefit of understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Through
here,” Kathryn said as she unlocked the heavy air tight bulkhead, “is what was
called the zero gravity bubble.&nbsp; It was apparently constructed while they
were on their way to Haven and was not part of the original design.&nbsp;
That’s why it was just cut into the bulkhead of the core room like this.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The door swung open, and as they entered the bubble Patricia
gasped loudly.&nbsp; She had seen the Earth from the shuttle, but they were
moving so quickly, and the image was artificial, she didn’t really understand
what she had been seeing.&nbsp; But here, there was no ambiguity.&nbsp; She was
left absolutely speechless.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It
must take you back hunh?” Kathryn asked Molly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She too was speechless, and pulled Kathryn into a hug.&nbsp;
“Thank you,” she whispered into her ear.&nbsp; “For everything.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The three spent nearly three hours in the bubble, watching
the world go by twice.&nbsp; The view from orbit was never the same no matter
how many times you went around.&nbsp; Kathryn took the opportunity to just
enjoy the view herself as well, and listen to Molly point out things to
Patricia and tell her stories about her past, things she’d seen, places she’d
been, people she’d known.&nbsp; When Orbital One passed underneath them some
ways down latitude off in the distance, she went into detail about her
relationship with Colin, how they’d met, their life together, their struggle to
commission a child… and their last days together.&nbsp; It had all of the
appearance of an elderly grandmother recounting stories of her life to her
adoring granddaughter, and Kathryn found it an endearing moment of bonding to
witness between the two women, and she found herself wishing she’d known her
own grandmother better. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I…
don’t even know where to begin, President Kim offered speechlessly in her
recorded message responding to the one Kathryn had sent her detailing their
experiences so far. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A Kobol diplomatic staff had already been attached to the
president, and one of the first things they did was set up an interstellar
communications system which allowed her to use the Escher rifts to communicate
between worlds.&nbsp; It took an average of a little under twenty minutes for a
message to travel all the way down to the sun, through the rift, out the other
side, and all the way back to the other planet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m
immediately going to release your report to the press,” the president informed
her, “and encourage them to print it and get it to as many eyes as
possible.&nbsp; What you have accomplished already is… well, beyond our wildest
dreams.&nbsp; You are a planetary treasure, Captain Barnes, you will already be
remembered by our people for many generations and your career is only just
beginning.&nbsp; You embody our people’s pride, and hope, and
optimism.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, indeed.&nbsp; Go forth with your plans to help this
Molly simulant in any way that you can, especially if she will share Earth’s
history with us in return.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>President Kim’s expression darkened appreciably.&nbsp; “We
were all of course quite disturbed to learn of the fate of Earth though,
Captain Barnes.&nbsp; I mean…we knew something awful must have happened, but…
to know for certain, and in such grim detail… is almost too much.&nbsp; There
will be many nightmares on Haven in the coming weeks about it and about such a
thing happening to us here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>In
short, we are very impressed with your work to date, and yes we grant you full
discretion to proceed however you see fit.&nbsp; Also, please extend my warmest
greetings to your guests, as well as an invitation for them to visit Haven if
they find themselves in a position to do so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Good
luck Captain.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The screen switched off she leaned back in her chair.&nbsp;
She found herself overcome with a wave of homesickness which she hadn’t
anticipated.&nbsp; She switched the large scroll she’d watched the message on
to a comm display and pushed the appropriate button to hail Jaren.&nbsp; “Could
you join me in the conference room please?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Instead of answering, he showed up a few moments later,
having been very nearby on the bridge.&nbsp; He’d brought Molly and Patricia
with them, whom he’d been showing the bridge.&nbsp; Molly had been placed in a
proper wheelchair they’d found left over in ship’s storage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I got
a green light from command,” she informed him.&nbsp; “How ‘bout you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,”
he said a little awkwardly, now wishing a little that he’d left the others back
on the bridge.&nbsp; “Like I was, my people were… taken aback at first to learn
of the existence of simulants.&nbsp; However, the more I spoke to them, the
more I was able to convey that this is a completely new kind of technology
which even if we choose never to develop full simulants ourselves, an
understanding of the technology could be very useful to us in any number of
other ways.&nbsp; Once I was able to make them see this, they really turned
around on Earth.&nbsp; Suddenly it is quite worth study and exploration in
comparison to their previous attitude.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Excellent.&nbsp;
And Teresa?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>She
tells me her people are also quite enthusiastic to press forward.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Good!&nbsp;
It’s all settled then.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
should also add,” Jaren said, turning to Molly, “they’ve already directed our
top fusion researchers to begin working on a compact cell for you.&nbsp;
They’ll have to design one from scratch, and they’ll need detailed scans of
your, umm… remaining anatomy, but they have every confidence they’ll be able to
provide what you need.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I am
quite relieved to hear that Jaren, thank you very much.”&nbsp; The simulated
woman finally seemed to be warming to the man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Did
you ask how they are coming with the archive?” Kathryn asked Jaren.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I did,
they told me they’re very nearly done at this point.&nbsp; They’ve also assured
me that once they have finished reading the sheets, they will send a physical
data storage unit to Haven and Roma with the complete archive for their use as
well.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Good
to hear,” Kathryn said.&nbsp; “Well, there’s no reason to wait then, let’s get
everyone in here so we can plan the expedition.&nbsp; She reached forward to
access the comm display on the scroll again and Molly laughed a good natured
laugh at the sight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What?”
Kathryn asked, confused.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
don’t have thought control do you?&nbsp; You have to access everything with
touch!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Of
course…” Kathryn answered, still confused.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It was
all designed to be operated by thought control, and by touch for children who
didn’t have their Brainchip implanted yet,” Molly explained.&nbsp; “For me the
technology was built in, I mean that’s how I’m operating this wonderful chair
here, by thought control.&nbsp; I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to laugh at you.&nbsp;
My own people have to use touch, but well… I rather tend to regard them as
children,” she said with an apologetic look at Patricia.&nbsp; “It never
occurred that you all don’t have Brainchips, but you don’t do you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m
afraid I don’t even know what that is,” Kathryn admitted.&nbsp; “You’ll have to
excuse us, but my people had only just figured out rocketry and
electromagnetism when Jaren here showed up on our planet a few weeks ago.&nbsp;
It felt like he was looking at us like we were children because we haven’t
figured out something he calls ‘sub-atomic’.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Molly harrumphed.&nbsp; “And Earth before the plague would
have been equally boggled by the anti-matter technology sitting here in my
lap,” she observed.&nbsp; “So it goes, I suppose.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not long after, the entire New Horizon crew along with Molly
and Patricia had assembled in the now rather crowded conference room off of the
bridge.&nbsp; At Molly’s request, the ship’s telescopes had been trained on
what was left of Vancouver, and the image was displayed on the full wall screen
which the conference room was equipped with.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Definitely
not how I remember it…” Molly observed somberly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>But
this is how it was described by the scavengers we’ve sent out,” Patricia
commented.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
guess I’d hoped they were exaggerating…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From orbit, it largely looked like a dramatically hilly
area.&nbsp; They were trained on the Burrard peninsula which had been
completely covered with a forest of glass covered skyscrapers before the
plague.&nbsp; Any surrounding suburban areas were now completely re-absorbed by
nature and utterly indistinguishable from any other wild and uninhabited area.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The dramatic hills of the area were in fact the result of
the bases of the skyscrapers remaining intact, but the tops of them having
crumpled and fallen down around the bases of the buildings, creating dunes of
debris around the bases which helped to stabilize what remained of the
buildings, especially as soil and plant life covered and perfused every
surface.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Switching
views,” Felix said as he altered the image with a filter, “we can use ground
penetrating radar to show the internal structure of those mounds, and you can
see that the lower sections of many of the buildings which once stood are still
intact.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Molly’s eyes had welled up with tears.&nbsp; “This city was
once beautiful as I was…” she lamented with obvious deep sadness in her
voice.&nbsp; “It was a city of glass, every building a shimmering vision of
modernity.&nbsp; Oh how I wish you could see it as it was now…” she remarked as
she took one of Patricia’s hands with her one remaining hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
say that the lab they created you in was down there somewhere?” Jaren asked
her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes…”
she answered listlessly.&nbsp; “Somewhere.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
don’t know exactly where?” he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Arbutus
and West 16th if it helps,” she answered sarcastically.&nbsp; “Good luck
figuring out where that was in the mess that’s left down there now thought.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Hmm.&nbsp;
Well,” he asked her, “how do you suggest we proceed?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I have
to go down there myself,” she answered.&nbsp; “I just know that if I can get
down onto the ground down there I’d be able to get my bearings somehow… that
I’d intuitively know where I’m supposed to go, where… where I originally came
from.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
that’s going to be a problem,” Kathryn observed. &nbsp;“Look.”&nbsp; She
restored the true image to the wall with a few taps at her scroll.&nbsp; “Not
one bit of terrain down there is amenable to you rolling around in your chair,
and it’s too unsteady for us to safely carry you around in a chair either.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Molly nodded. &nbsp;“You’ll have to remove my head.”&nbsp;
Several people in the room audibly gasped at her ghastly suggestion, including
Patricia.&nbsp; “Hey, I’m not super hot on the idea myself, but it’s the best
way.&nbsp; We saw the ship’s onboard simulant laboratory.&nbsp; There were no spare
parts which could help restore me, but it was fully equipped with the
appropriate tools to conduct such a procedure.&nbsp; All I need is my head and
this power source.&nbsp; Rig up some sort of backpack and somebody can carry
them together around on their back as you make your way through the ruins.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It
could work,” Jaren offered as he stared pensively at the wall screen.&nbsp;
“It’s not ideal, but… it could work.&nbsp; It’s risky,” he said, turning to
Molly.&nbsp; “You’re sure this is what you want.&nbsp; You’re sure you can talk
us through the procedure?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes
and yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Leader,”
Patricia pleaded, “I am uncomfortable with this.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Fear
not child,” Molly reassured her, “you’re coming with us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
head is designed to come off,” Molly explained as she drew a line around her
neck in the mirror with a black marker.&nbsp; “Not easily of course, but for
repair and maintenance and such it is intended to be possible with some
effort.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everyone in the room seemed rather uneasy, especially Jaren
who had been tasked by Molly to conduct the procedure with Felix’s assistance,
given their success with switching over her power source.&nbsp; None were more
apprehensions than poor Patricia though.&nbsp; Right before her eyes she was to
be forced to watch strangers remove the head of a being she considered something
closer to a deity than a person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Molly laid down on the examination table in the centre of
the sim-bay where the simulants who had founded Kathryn’s civilization had been
stored for the long journey to Haven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Cut
along the line, as deep as you’re able to down to the substructure.&nbsp;
You’ll come across a material like you can see in the exposed parts of my
skull.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren began moving the scalpel towards her skin but paused
to ask, “will you bleed?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No,”
she answered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren cocked his head to the side momentarily with
uncertainty before slowly moving the scalpel to her neck again.&nbsp; He paused
again to ask another question and the other people in the room signed loudly in
frustration.&nbsp; “Oh come on!” someone uttered in nervous frustration.&nbsp;
Jaren asked her if she would feel pain when he cut her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
will,” she answered, “but not as much as you’d think,” she reassured him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
figured you’d bleed…” Jaren remarked as he began his incision and watched her
wince with what seemed to be considerable, but ultimately bearable
discomfort.&nbsp; “I imagined it was some kind of living skin overtop of an
artificial substructure.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No,”
she managed as Jaren moved around to the other side of the table to cut along
the other side of her neck.&nbsp; “If that were the case then the skin would of
course have died away centuries ago.&nbsp; It is simply an incredibly advanced
synthetic substitute which perfectly mimics skin but only superficially.&nbsp;
It even heals over with time just like skin when it’s cut, even though it
doesn’t bleed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Felix and Francis rolled Molly’s body over so that Jaren
could complete the cut along the back of her neck, and then rolled her
back.&nbsp; “Okay, done.” Jaren said with relief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Alright,
next there will be a series of eight screws along the point of incision at
regular intervals.&nbsp; They all need to be removed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the three engineers got to work unfastening the screws,
she explained further: “okay, the hard part will be when you have to disconnect
me from the power supply input on my chest coming up through the neck, and plug
the different connection directly into the base of my skull.&nbsp; It’s the
different power connector we found in that cabinet.&nbsp; You’ll have to swap
the adapters after disconnecting me, and then plug the new one into the same
place you disconnect the power supply from the body.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Okay
that’s all of the screws,” Jaren answered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Alright,
you should be able to pull my head about an inch away from my neck, everything
in there is designed to have that much give.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren carefully did just that, and pulled her head slightly
away from her body.&nbsp; Some people in the room were aghast with horror at
the scene while others were rapt with morbid fascination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Okay,”
Molly said with a noticeably and comically elevated pitch to her voice having
her vocal cords stretched, “this is the last instructions I’ll be able to give
you.&nbsp; My esophagus and trachea each have three little clips you have to
undo to separate them from the body.&nbsp; After that you need to unplug the
data cable running along where your spinal cord would be.&nbsp; It has a little
lock switch you need to flip before it will come free, same goes for the power
cord.&nbsp; When you remove the power cord I’ll go dark again, but you’ll be
able to remove my head completely, and plug in the power source directly to the
head.&nbsp; I should come right back on my own just like before, but if I don’t
the hard restart in my head I mentioned before is right beside the power
connector.&nbsp; There’s a little red button and a little green button right
beside it.&nbsp; You hold down the red button for three seconds and then push
the green while still holding the red.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Is all
of that clear?” she asked while looking around at the engineers standing over
her.&nbsp; They all nodded somberly.&nbsp; Molly sighed heavily.&nbsp; “Very
well then… proceed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren, Felix, and Francis all worked together to do exactly
what she said.&nbsp; When they uncoupled her trachea she was no longer able to
breathe.&nbsp; At this point it felt like everyone in the room was holding
their breath as they finished uncoupling the data cable, and holding his breath
himself, Jaren finally disconnected the power supply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Exhaling slowly and reaching for the different power
adapter, he looked at her face as he switched the adapters.&nbsp; Beyond the
uneasiness of seeing her lifeless with her mouth agape and her one remaining
eye wide open, she further set him ill at ease with the way she somehow seemed
both alive and dead at the same time, like a perfect replica of a human being,
but without that unquantifiable and indefinable spark of life.&nbsp; He found
himself wondering if this is what a human would look like if somehow drained of
their soul while still alive.&nbsp; He shook his head to clear the thought as
he firmly implanted the power adapter into the appropriate socket on the
underside of her brain case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The silence in the room was deafening as they waited to see
what would happen next.&nbsp; At some point they realized that something was
wrong, that she had been lifeless noticeably longer than she had been down in
the dam.&nbsp; Now somewhat unsure of himself, Jaren sighed and rolled his head
to the side as he reached for the red button and held it down.&nbsp; After a
few seconds he pressed the green button and her eye shot wide open and she made
the motion of drawing the deep dramatic breath of someone clutched from the
brink of death, but it was ersatz; she no longer had lungs to draw in air to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When she came to life, everyone in the room jumped back in
frightened surprise.&nbsp; Those nearest to her seemed to jump back several
feet before coming to their senses and sharing a nervous laugh with everyone
else.&nbsp; They watched as Molly’s head attempted to speak but made no
sound.&nbsp; It frowned in frustration, then closed its eyes for several
seconds with a furrowed brow and an eye clearly darting about underneath its eyelid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Can
you hear me now?” a voice which sounded somewhat like Molly’s but not quite,
asked over the ship’s broadcast speakers in the room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn laughed.&nbsp; “Yes Molly, we can.&nbsp; Is
everything alright?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The disembodied voice harrumphed along with the silent
facial expression of a harrumph on the disembodied head lying on the
table.&nbsp; “Aside from being decapitated?&nbsp; Oh sure…” she answered with
an ironic drawl.&nbsp; “Do a poor head a favour would you?&nbsp; Bring a small
scroll over here and put it in front of my face,” the head asked.&nbsp; Kathryn
pulled out her own scroll from her pocket, pulled it apart and held it up in
front of the head’s face.&nbsp; It again scowled with a searching closed eye
underneath a furrowed brow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Is it
coming through the scroll now,” the disembodied head asked, its voice now
coming from the scroll instead of the speakers about the room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It is
Leader, it is,” Patricia reassured her as she stood beside her and stroked what
was left of her hair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Excellent,”
the voice offered sardonically.&nbsp; “Well then bundle me up already, and
let’s get going.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class=MsoNormal>Chapter 17</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>The shuttle shot away from the New Horizon and plunged into
the Terran atmosphere.&nbsp; Inside was Jaren piloting the shuttle, Kathryn,
Felix, Francis, Terey and Molly’s head.&nbsp; The engineers had rigged up a back
pack consisting of Molly’s battery and her head above, facing backwards, and
Francis had been burdened with carrying her around when they reached the
surface.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We’ll
have to be careful choosing a landing site…” Jaren observed as he looked at the
scans of the surface on the panel in front of him.&nbsp; “The terrain appears
quite unstable, prone to shifting…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s
what our scavengers report,” Molly confirmed.&nbsp; “It’s detritus piled on
detritus covered in soil and plant.&nbsp; Any extra weight tends to either
cause sinking or collapse.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Right,”
Jaren acknowledged with a furrowed brow.&nbsp; “Molly, homeworld had recovered
the old Terran maps from the archives when I contacted them and they
transmitted them to me before we left the ship.&nbsp; The address you provided…
even with the maps it’s hard to pin down exactly the area you referenced, but
we can at certainly narrow it down to within several kilometers at least.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That
should be good enough.&nbsp; Once there on the surface and in the area I’m
hoping I’ll be able to get my bearings and find my way to the lab, if it still
exists of course.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What
are the odds of that?” Kathryn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Poor
to fair,” Molly answered.&nbsp; “I remember it being in one of the lower floors
of a tower, and if any parts of the building survived, it would be the lower
levels.&nbsp; Even so, if it’s still intact it’ll be buried and require
excavation, some very dangerous excavation,” she remarked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Grand,”
Felix ironically remarked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m
going to set it down on top of one of those sharp hills,” Jaren said as he continued
to look at his monitors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’ll be tricky climbing up and down,
but I prefer that to putting down in one of the valleys and risk having debris
fall down on the ship.&nbsp; There’s no guarantee we’d be able to dig it out
again.&nbsp; There could be a collapse when we touch down, but I’ll do it
softly and add the weight gradually, ready to shoot up again if there’s a
problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From visual observations and ground penetrating scans, Jaren
selected a hill he felt most suitable in the area Molly indicated.&nbsp; He
lowered the shuttle very slowly down onto the thick green grass covering the
mound, blowing down and away the blades from the central energy stream pouring
out of the bottom of the shuttle.&nbsp; The landing struts softly touched the
ground and as Jaren slowly let the weight of the vessel down, the struts sunk
into the soil several decimeters, but then held as the rest of the shuttle’s
weight settled onto the support points.&nbsp; Gradually letting off the
throttle, Jaren powered down the engine and an eerie silence filled the cabin
as everyone held their breath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We’re
good,” Jaren reported, and the silence was broken by a collective exhale.&nbsp;
“Lowering the door.”&nbsp; The door section of the wall fell away, and the
extension ramp projected from within it and touched down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
let’s get on with it,” Molly said.&nbsp; Francis picked her up and slung her
over his back as gently as she could.&nbsp; “Don’t worry about being gentle
Francis, just don’t lose your head,” she said with a mirthful smirk to the
others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn moved to be the first out the door but Jaren grabbed
her arm as if to stop her from going first and allowing him to instead.&nbsp;
She stopped, looked back at his hand on her arm, and then up at him with a look
which said: ‘really?’&nbsp; He understood and let her go.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ramp was at a steep incline and she carefully made her
way down, one sideways set foot after another.&nbsp; Coming to the bottom of
the ramp she tested the ground and found that it would indeed hold up to her
weight.&nbsp; “Seems okay,” she offered to the others and began making her way
down the hill even more carefully.&nbsp; It was roughly a forty degree slant
down several stories to the wooded area between the hills.&nbsp; The others
followed behind her in a line down to the low land.&nbsp; Reaching the tree
line and descending the hill further, she reached the bottom of the gulley and
found a modest creek in a deep cavity.&nbsp; She leaned down to run her fingers
through the running water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>This
used to be an underground transit train line,” Molly told her.&nbsp; “I rode
this line many, many times…” she said, seeming to be lost in her
memories.&nbsp; “It’s strange, everything looks different and yet it’s somehow
so familiar.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Any
idea where to head?” Felix asked Molly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No… I
have a sense of the route this skytrain took back in the day though.&nbsp; If
we follow along it, I may be able to get a sense of our location.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was no path for them, so they had to make their way
very slowly and carefully through the trees and thick underbrush by the
stream.&nbsp; They would occasionally see small animals they didn’t recognize
briefly come into view and then quickly scurry off, but it was too quick for
Francis to turn Molly around so she could see and identify them.&nbsp;
“Probably rats, raccoons, skunks…” she offered as she bobbed up and down
looking behind Francis.&nbsp; Felix was the only one behind her, and she had
the opportunity to scrutinize him face to face as they walked.&nbsp; It was
beginning to make him uncomfortable, she had that knowing smirk and had nowhere
to look but right in his face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You’re
gay aren’t you?” she asked shamelessly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Um
yeah, that’s right… Kathryn tell you that?” he asked.&nbsp; He wasn’t
embarrassed; it was no secret after all.&nbsp; He just didn’t know how it would
have come up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No,”
she answered, her smirk growing broader into a smile as she bobbed up and down
and back and forth.&nbsp; “I was a sexim remember?&nbsp; I was programmed to
know these things, programmed to be sensitive to the… desires and persuasions
of men and women.&nbsp; It’s nothing specific I can just tell, a sense
generated from a lot of unconscious cues and factors.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
see,” Felix replied, still a little uncomfortable over the scrutiny.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That
must be why I didn’t have the immediate dislike of you I tend to have of other
men,” she observed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Perhaps…
I think-”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Look
out!!” Molly cried out in horror as a large cougar jumped out of a nearby tree
and pounced on Felix, taking him down to the ground.&nbsp; The rest of the team
scrambled to come to his aid as the cougar clawed at Felix and tried to bite
his neck.&nbsp; He held his arms up between his neck and the creature’s teeth
and claws and his forearms and hands were quickly becoming shredded in a
horrible bloody mess.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first to respond, Francis instinctively reared back and
kicked the cougar as hard as he could in the ribs.&nbsp; It yelped in pain, and
then pounced on Francis, knocking him back on the ground, landing hard on the
backpack containing Molly and her power source.&nbsp; The cat returned to Felix
who was quickly bleeding to death and making horrible sobs of pain.&nbsp; It
bit into his leg and appeared to being dragging him into the brush.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn had picked up a substantial fallen branch and before
the cougar could drag Felix out of view she hammered it on the head as hard as
she could with the branch.&nbsp; It cried in pain and then staggered off in an
apparent daze off into the bush, unseen once more.&nbsp; All three gathered around
Felix to assess the damage.&nbsp; He was writhing in agony and gushing blood
out of his arms and leg.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elim whipped her medical bag off of her back and pushed the
others away.&nbsp; Though a trained doctor herself, she was of Haven and their
medical technology was far inferior to that of Kobol or even Roma for that
matter, but she had a Kobol medical kit with her and had been trained by
Nadelle how to use all of the supplies in it.&nbsp; She knew she had to move
quickly or he would quickly be dead from loss of blood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Is he
going to be okay?” Kathryn fearfully asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Let me
work,” was all Elim would say as she cinched some straps down on his limbs
above the damage to slow blood flow to the area and thus his blood loss.&nbsp;
She then used sterile water to clean out his wounds and then spray a
coagulating agent into the wounds.&nbsp; It was a brute force substance that
shared some of the same properties as a human’s own platelets, and bonded with
the subjects own binding agents as well as artificial ones in the spray, which
activated when sprayed.&nbsp; It quickly formed an artificial scab over the
wounds which stopped the bleeding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elim then pulled a transdermic from the kit and administered
a powerful sedative and pain killer combination.&nbsp; Felix’s nonsensical
whining sobs of pain and deep dismay slowly dissipated and gave way to blessed
unconsciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elim was emotionally amped up from the excitement, but let
out a long deep sigh.&nbsp; “I think he’ll be alright,” she said turning to
Kathryn.&nbsp; “On Haven… well he might not have survived at all, and even if
he did he’d be in for a long, long recovery, likely nerve damage, nasty
scarring…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>But?”
Kathryn asked anxiously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>But as
far as I understand the medical chambers on New Horizon, it can physically
rebuild tissue.&nbsp; It could take a couple days, but it should be able to
rebuild his damaged tissues cell layer by cell layer.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Then
we need to get him back to the ship.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>As
soon as possible, yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn and Jaren carried Felix back up the hill to the
shuttle with all due haste while still observing the danger whic the terrain
posed.&nbsp; Elim and Francis carrying Molly followed behind, watching their
back and sides for any further potential attack.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They were all very quiet as Jaren piloted the ship back up
to orbit and to dock with New Horizon.&nbsp; They pulled the unconscious Felix
along in the zero gravity, and then used the same harness and winch line to
lower him down the access tube to the habitat ring as they had used to move
Molly down.&nbsp; A rolling medical bed was waiting for them and his body was lowered
directly onto it, followed closely behind by Kathryn and the others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Treatment
so far?” Nadelle asked Elim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I used
the binding agent you instructed me on and gave him the combination sedative
and painkiller.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Good
work.&nbsp; These shouldn’t be necessary anymore,” Nadelle observed as the bed
was rolled down the hall and into an elevator.&nbsp; She pulled a pair of
scissors out of the kit and cut his tourniquets off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>He’ll
be alright?” Kathryn asked Nadelle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh
yeah, no worries,” Nadelle answered nonchalantly.&nbsp; “He’ll be right as rain
after a couple of days in the sarcophagus.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Sarcophagus?”
Jaren asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh,
our little nickname for the surgical pods.&nbsp; They’ll be able to reconstruct
his damaged tissue no problem.&nbsp; It’s one of their primary functions.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The elevator doors opened and Felix was rolled across the
hall into the medical bay.&nbsp; Nadelle tapped at the panel and the clear
circular hatch at one end of the chamber swung away, and a human body sized
shelf slid towards them.&nbsp; They lifted his body onto the shelf and with
another panel tap the shelf slid back into the device and the cover swung
closed again and sealed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The interior lit up and the chamber began conducting all
manner of scans on his body.&nbsp; A list of recommended procedures appeared on
the screen above the chamber, and Nadelle tapped the proceed button.&nbsp; Deft
and soft mechanical hands picked up a pair of scissors and began carefully
cutting off his pants and shirt.&nbsp; When it had adequately exposed the
damaged areas, it would carefully strip away the artificial scab one small
section at a time and replace it with new tissue synthesized from his own
DNA.&nbsp; Once the first layer of tissue was installed and covering the
entirety of the wound, nerve, muscle, and skin cells would be laid down layer
by layer until the wound was entirely repaired.&nbsp; The screen above the
chamber initiated a countdown starting at twenty-seven hours, five minutes, and
twenty-eight seconds until repair complete, and began counting down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Francis set the Molly pack down on the floor and propped it
up against the wall.&nbsp; Her eyes were full of tears.&nbsp; “It’s my fault…”
she muttered.&nbsp; “I’m so sorry.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes…”
Kathryn agreed.&nbsp; “It is your fault.”&nbsp; She breathed deeply in through
her nose as she turned to her.&nbsp; “But we made a deal, and we all knew the
risks.&nbsp; It’s our fault too… we were reckless.&nbsp; We should have been
better organized, better equipped… we should have planned better.&nbsp; We
won’t make that mistake again.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Again?”
Jaren asked.&nbsp; “We’re going back down there?”&nbsp; He didn’t seem to be
questioning her or suggesting they shouldn’t, but it clearly hadn’t occurred to
him that they would try again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I…”
Molly started.&nbsp; “I want to tell you that you don’t have to, but… I have no
body at all now.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
know,” Kathryn said as she put a hand on the transparent material of the
sarcophagus.&nbsp; “But it’s not just about you Molly.&nbsp; We aren’t just
going down there to find you a body.&nbsp; We’re explorers.&nbsp; We went down
there to explore.&nbsp; Our task on this planet isn’t over now that we’ve
solved the mystery of why it went dark so many centuries ago, and it won’t be
over when we’ve helped restore you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We’ve
begun something here, together,” she said as she looked seriously at Jaren and
Francis.&nbsp; “Earth is not just a neutral planet we can survey and abandon,
not a mere curiosity.&nbsp; It is our home, our ancestral home.&nbsp; It is our
destiny to learn all of the secrets this planet has to offer us.&nbsp; The
archives aren’t enough, Molly’s memories are insufficient.&nbsp; We will
research this place for ourselves, and tease out of it every secret about our
heritage and… ourselves which we can.&nbsp; Restoring Molly is only the first
step, only the first secret we must reveal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We are
all at the beginning of a very long journey.&nbsp; I intend to personally
petition our governments to collectively fully restore Orbital One, and make it
the home base for a massive research effort, archaeological digs of the ruins,
anthropological research of the people still down there and assistance in them
reclaiming the dignity which is their birthright as Terran humans, if they want
our help.&nbsp; We will research, we will rebuild, we will restore.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Felix
wouldn’t want us to give up.&nbsp; He wouldn’t want what happened to him to be
the end of this journey.&nbsp; Yes we’re going back, but this time we’re doing
it right, and we’re going to ask for some help from our friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Molly,
you have explorers in your village who have been to the ruins of Vancouver and
returned.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,”
she answered.&nbsp; “Most of our males have made at least one expedition
south.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Will
they accompany us on our next trip down?&nbsp; Their experience would be
invaluable to us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>They
will do whatever I order them to,” Molly stated.&nbsp; “I’m sure they’d be
happy to help,” she added, sensing the discomfort in the room with her previous
phrasing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Good.&nbsp;
When we’re done here please contact them and have them prepare.&nbsp; Have them
be armed however they normally would be, those blow darts they got me with
would come in handy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Understood.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Jaren,
we need weapons, whatever weapons we have let’s pass them out.”&nbsp; Jaren nodded.&nbsp;
“Is your shuttle equipped with weapons?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No,
it’s just a transport ship, nothing like that.&nbsp; We’ve got scroll flashers,
our wands, several printed handguns, that’s it though.&nbsp; We can print
more.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Do
so.&nbsp; We’ll mount a full expedition, both shuttles.&nbsp; Molly please have
your six best men prepare and have them ready in-” she looked at the countdown
clock on the wall “twenty-eight hours.&nbsp; We’ll leave Felix here with three
others but I want to see him okay before we head down again.&nbsp; We’ll leave
them on the ship to maintain its systems and give us imaging support with
continuous infra-red monitoring to warn us of any threats in the area.&nbsp; If
we weren’t so careless they could have warned us about that, that… what was
that Molly?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The head harrumphed a little through the scroll tucked into
the bag which made sounds for her.&nbsp; “The males call them murdercats,
differentiated from the friendlycats and the angrycats.&nbsp; However they were
known in the before time as cougars, house cats, and bobcats respectively.&nbsp;
Cougars like the one that attacked Felix can take down large game by themselves
and are incredibly dangerous.&nbsp; House cats used to be pets and are mostly
harmless, bobcats are a bit bigger than the housecats and typically won’t
attack a human unless threatened.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
other threats down there can you tell us about?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
large mammals called bears will attack you first chance they get and are twice
your size.&nbsp; They’re solitary unlike the wolves who live in packs of a
dozen or so.&nbsp; They’re crafty and some will distract you while the others
attack from a direction you aren’t expecting them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rest nodded understandingly.&nbsp; They all lived in
cites, but their cities all gave way to wilderness, and each planet had their
own monsters out there that they warned their children about with good reason.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
about large prey animals?” Francis asked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Deer
most prominently,” Molly answered.&nbsp; “There are other species, but around
Vancouver these days it’s mostly deer.&nbsp; My people say they’re quite tasty,
but… well, they say the same things about the bears.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class=MsoNormal>Chapter 18</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn was leaning against the medical chamber half asleep
when Elim sheepishly walked in.&nbsp; Not only was she exhausted, but as it
worked the chamber produced a gentle vibrating hum which she found oddly comforting.&nbsp;
Elim pulled up a chair and sat beside her with a stunned look on his
face.&nbsp; Kathryn roused enough to notice he was there and asked how Felix
was doing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh,”
Elim said before standing up and coming around to the other side of the chamber
to examine the display panel.&nbsp; “Coming along nicely it says, still another
ten hours to go, but no complications.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Good
to hear, good to hear…&nbsp; Were you worried about him too?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No, I
mean… yes, of course I’m worried about Felix.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn became aware that something was bothering Elim, and
quite profoundly from what she could tell as she scrutinized him more
closely.&nbsp; “What is it Elim?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I…” he
sighed, “I wasn’t sure I should tell you, I… I didn’t know what to do when I
found out.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn sat up straight, fully alert now.&nbsp; “When you
found out what?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elim picked up a chair and set it down in front of Kathryn,
facing her.&nbsp; He then sat down on it heavily.&nbsp; “The virus.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The one
that brought Earth down?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yeah.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
about it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well…
I couldn’t sleep after Felix was attacked with how worried I was about him and
all, so I went to the lab to do some work.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn nodded her understanding.&nbsp; It was common for
her as well to occupy her mind with work when she couldn’t sleep for one reason
or another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
wanted to do a more detailed analysis of the virus.&nbsp; I wanted to piece
together whether it had been developed maliciously, or accidentally, or
developed for testing and accidentally released… that sort of thing.&nbsp; I
figured if I took a closer look I could answer some questions and get a better
idea of exactly how it happened.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
I’ve been using the Koboli equipment to do the research since it’s the most
advanced, and…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was obvious that there was something the man wanted to
say but couldn’t find a way to bring himself to form the words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Out
with it Elim.&nbsp; What did you find?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Using
the Koboli equipment, it became clear that the virus had markers on it which
could only be there if the Koboli had created the virus themselves.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn stared blankly at him.&nbsp; “I don’t understand,
what are you saying?&nbsp; The virus struck Earth six hundred years ago.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
but…” Elim sighed in exasperation as he stood up and began pacing.&nbsp; “You
have to understand that I’ve only been trying to piece this all together myself
on the way here.&nbsp; They never had the same collapse of technological
capacity we had on Haven.&nbsp; Their biomedical technology is continuous with
original Earth tech before the fall, and they’ve only built on it since.&nbsp;
If they used original Earth tech to create the virus back then, and have only
built on that technology now, that would explain the correlations I’m seeing
here now.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn was stunned.&nbsp; Rage, confusion, and desperation
may come later, but presently she was too stunned at the suggestion to feel
anything at all.&nbsp; “Do you realize what you’re saying?&nbsp; The scale of
the accusation you’re making?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How
could it have happened?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>They
could have developed it en route and shot it back at Earth on their way to
Kobol.&nbsp; The timelines would match up.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn remained silent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It
would explain a few things.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn looked at him in such a way as to invite his
elaboration.&nbsp; Elim sat down facing her again and proceeded to use his
hands to assist his hands in explanation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>One.&nbsp;
They had no interest in coming to Earth, and we never really understood
why.&nbsp; This would be a good reason.&nbsp; They knew exactly what they’d
find and why.&nbsp; Two.&nbsp; How quickly and easily they were able to
‘develop’ a cure,” he said using air quotes.&nbsp; “They didn’t have to develop
dick all!&nbsp; They already had a cure or knew how to make one because they
created the fucking disease!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Three,”
Kathryn added.&nbsp; “They’ve been here before.”&nbsp; Elim looked up at
her.&nbsp; “We missed that,” she explained.&nbsp; “They said they’d been here
on the surface at least once, long enough to realize they had no interests
here.&nbsp; If that’s true they would have encountered the virus as surely as
we did, so they had to have known about it already.&nbsp; They didn’t mention
when we launched this mission because they knew they could easily cure us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Son of
a bitch.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
used to have a word for that,” a mechanically hollow voice came from a dark
corner of the room.&nbsp; “Genocide.”&nbsp; Kathryn had forgotten that Molly
was propped up in the corner.&nbsp; She had remained silent to hear the rest of
the conversation, but now she spoke up.&nbsp; “Everything I witnessed, billions
of dead, suffering upon suffering upon suffering.&nbsp; Their doing.&nbsp; They
are lucky I no longer have arms to rip them apart with.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren was delighted when he received a summons in his suite
from Kathryn to join her in the medical bay.&nbsp; He’d been concerned that
she’d felt a little distant the last couple of days.&nbsp; He’d been brushing
it off as them having work to do and there simply not being time for their
stolen moments of affection, but he missed her all the same.&nbsp; When he
entered the medical bay she stood up to greet him and he rushed over to hug
her, but her hand on his chest held him back from her, and there was something
in her eyes, a seething he’d never seen before.&nbsp; Whatever it was it
immediately scared him when he recognized it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Elim
was just here, and he shared with me a discovery he made.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
in studying the virus.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yeah,”
she nodded.&nbsp; “It was you, the fucking Mormons.&nbsp; You did it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
not me persona-”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Don’t.&nbsp;
You, lied to me about it though.&nbsp; Your people lied to all the rest of us
about it, but you lied to me about it.&nbsp; All those hours we spent together,
the times we spent together in bed, the mornings we woke up together, not once
could you ever find an appropriate moment to tell me that your people committed
genocide?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>When
is an appropriate time to confess to genocide Kathryn?”&nbsp; His voice was
icy, nowhere near as conciliatory and pathetic as she’d hoped he’d be.&nbsp;
She hated to have to admit to herself that he had a point.&nbsp; “My people
have many faults, and have done much wrong, but what we did to Earth is… our
original sin, that for which we can never atone.&nbsp; It is this guilt which
urged us to establish contact with and help Haven and Roma.&nbsp; You both keep
wanting to know what our angle is, what we want to get back from you for our
help, well there it is.&nbsp; We wish to atone, to maybe, someday… be forgiven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
the people who launched on the Mormon generational starship were fanatics, and
the most fanatical among them hatched a conspiracy once underway, one later
condemned by all of the rest.&nbsp; In secret they engineered a virus and a
rocket to eventually bring it back to Earth.&nbsp; They launched it before
anyone else onboard knew.&nbsp; They were eventually found out, but by then it
was too late.&nbsp; We were never able to confirm what happened to Earth until
we developed rift technology and could check for ourselves, but when we did our
worst fears were confirmed.&nbsp; We never came back because the shame was,
well… overwhelming.&nbsp; It was too painful a reminder to be here.&nbsp; My
people have had to live with that shame every day for the last six hundred
years.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
lied to me!” Kathryn exclaimed, “to me!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes, I
did!” he snarled back, much to her surprise.&nbsp; “I was under orders Kathryn,
remember orders Captain Barnes?&nbsp; Remember how much you like about me that
the work comes first?&nbsp; Just like you?&nbsp; My government was working on
how to reveal this in the least disruptive way now that we were all in mutual
contact, we were working on some way to formally apologize and atone, it was
not my place to step out ahead of my government, you must be able to understand
that.&nbsp; Kathryn… I wanted to tell you a thousand times.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Get
out.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Kat…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Get
out.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren looked as though he was going to cry, but he stiffened
his expression and held back.&nbsp; He nodded shallowly his understanding and
without another word turned and left through the sliding medical bay doors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
there you go,” Molly’s head said from the shadows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn’s body remained stiff and rigid, kept so by proxy to
her keeping her emotions clamped down.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now feeling vacant and numb
she made her way over to Molly’s head, stood beside it, fell against the wall
and slumped down to the ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Penny
for your thoughts,” the head said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>His
people killed billions.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>And
yet… all I can think about is that he lied to me about it.&nbsp; How can that
possibly compare, let alone feel more important?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Because
you love him,” Molly’s head explained, “and because you’re a human being.&nbsp;
It’s your nature.&nbsp; You understand big, but you feel small.&nbsp; So it
goes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I do
love him… and I fucking hate him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Such
is love.&nbsp; I hate him too, but it’s easier for me.&nbsp; I hate him by
association, for being part of the group that perpetrated so much evil to me
and mine, that brought down the civilization I loved so much, for leading to
the death of my love.&nbsp; But in the end, he didn’t do any of these things
himself.&nbsp; His only sin was keeping it a secret for others.&nbsp; Easier
for me to forgive him personally, but for you… for you with the trust and love
you put in him, the lying is a far greater sin than any guilt by association
for a genocide generations ago.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I… I
had a fianc&eacute; Molly, back on Haven?&nbsp; We split just before I left on my
mission to Kobol, before anything happened with Jaren.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
thought I loved him, but he never could have hurt me like this.&nbsp; I loved
him, but I had no idea how pale my feelings were until I got swept up with
Jaren, until he hurt me this way.&nbsp; This is what real love feels like isn’t
it?&nbsp; This is how it hurts…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Not
all the time child, but yes.&nbsp; The more you love, the more you can
hurt.&nbsp; That’s how it works.&nbsp; That’s the bargain.&nbsp; Can I tell you
a secret thought?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn chuckled.&nbsp; “Sure…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It’s
always worth it.&nbsp; As much as it hurts worse when it hurts, in retrospect
the joy always outweighs the hurt.&nbsp; As much as I loved the world before
the fall, it was all too grey.&nbsp; It was full of grey people who didn’t love
with all their heart, who didn<span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>’</span>t
strive with every inch they had to give.&nbsp; They never hurt terribly badly in
disappointment or heartbreak, but you know what?&nbsp; They never really lived
either, and it always made me sad to see.&nbsp; Some did though, like the
people who went on the mission to found your colony.&nbsp; They knew how badly
the odds were against them, but they went anyways, because it was something to
live for, because they were in love with the possibility of it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
don’t think I’ll ever be able to forgive him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well
that’s the great part,” the head laughed through the scroll tucked in the
backpack it jutted out of.&nbsp; “If you can’t you don’t have to!&nbsp; Plus
you’ll have learned a lot from the experience either way.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two were quiet for some time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>So
what do I do now?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
think first you need to decide what you’re going to do about the virus.&nbsp; I
know your instinct is to tell everyone.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Of
course.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Molly hesitated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
is it?” Kathryn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
told me that the Mormons waited to contact you long enough for you to make your
own way to this ship, right?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Your
people appreciated that didn’t you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Maybe
you should extend the same courtesy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How do
you mean?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Jaren
said that his government was working right now on how to reveal what they did
and come up with some sort of reconciliation offer.&nbsp; Maybe the best thing
you could do would be to have Jaren signal his government that they’re found
out, but keep it to yourself for a short while to allow them to do it their
way.&nbsp; Yes they’ve all lied to you about it, but try to keep in mind they
are a dozen generations removed from those who actually did it, and that
according to Jaren it was a small faction of them even, who were in turn
condemned by the rest of them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That
would probably be best, but then I’d be complicit in the lying.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>And
that’s the rub.&nbsp; Perhaps now you better understand the position Jaren
found himself in?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Damn
you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The head chuckled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The door slid open to Jaren’s suite and Kathryn stood in the
doorway.&nbsp; Jaren got up to greet her, but he kept his distance in response
to her outstretched hand.&nbsp; She entered the door and let it close behind
her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I hate
that you lied to me,” she finally said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Kat-”
he tried to protest but she stopped him by putting her hand up again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Just
listen.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He nodded and sat down on his bed to listen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I hate
that you lied to me.&nbsp; I don’t think I can ever look at you the same way
again.&nbsp; I don’t know if I can ever forgive you for keeping something so
big and important from me regardless of why you did it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren was obviously frustrated but remained silent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That
being said, I… I can understand the position you were in.&nbsp; I understand
that I made it clear that professional responsibilities had to come first for
us.&nbsp; Hell this is why us getting involved while we worked together was a
bad idea in the first place.&nbsp; I need time to figure out what this means
for us, if I can get past it.&nbsp; I just don’t know right now.&nbsp; The hurt
is just too fresh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That
being said Jaren, if what you say is true, that your government is working on
how to announce this and try to make amends, I don’t feel justified taking that
away from them.&nbsp; A formal confession would be better for all of the
colonies than a sudden revelation of a cover-up.&nbsp; For everyone’s sake I
will implicate myself.&nbsp; I will share in your lie, and get Elim to as well.&nbsp;
But you must tell your government that they must make their move soon, that my
silence is temporary only.&nbsp; Do you understand?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Will
you tell your people this?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Right
away.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Will
they move quickly?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Under
threat?&nbsp; I believe they will.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Good.”&nbsp;
Kathryn turned and walked to the door.&nbsp; As it opened Jaren called her name
and she stopped in the door way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Time
and space, Jaren,” she said without looking back before continuing through the
door.&nbsp; “Time and space,” she said again as the door closed behind her.&#8195;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class=MsoNormal>Chapter 19</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn sat alone in the room.&nbsp; She was leaning forward
with her elbows rested on her knees and her chin on her clasped hands, watching
the countdown on the wall tick down the last seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The clear round end of the sarcophagus slid away, and a
small amount of mist rolled out of the chamber as the warm moist air inside
clashed and cooled as it mixed with the cooler and drier air of the rest of the
ship.&nbsp; As the tray Felix’s body had been lying on extended out of the
chamber, Kathryn stood and walked over to it and looked down on her friend’s
face to see his eyes open and blink several time as consciousness slowly arose
in him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She looked on him fondly and with sympathy as he looked up
at her and then lifted himself up on his hands into a sitting position.&nbsp;
He didn’t say anything to her, instead he looked at his hands and forearms,
slowly rotating them in front of his eyes in disbelief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Did
it… did it really happen?” he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh
yes,” Kathryn answered softly.&nbsp; “It really happened.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It’s
hard to believe,” he said in wonderment.&nbsp; “I, I honestly can’t tell the
difference.&nbsp; It’s good as new…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m
sorry Felix,” she said, backing off as he swung his body around and hung his
legs off the side, and after a moment of gathering his strength he stood on his
feet.&nbsp; He faltered for a moment, but found his strength and recovered
before Kathryn could finish coming to his aid and she backed off again.&nbsp;
He was naked, but she hardly noticed.&nbsp; Between being in the service
together, being best friends, and the absolute absence of sexual tension
between them, both had seen the other naked any number of times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>About
what?” he asked as he reached for the fresh clothes which had been laid out for
him.&nbsp; She might not have noticed or cared herself, but anyone else could
walk in at any moment, and basic modesty drew him to the clothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
happened to you.&nbsp; It’s my fault.&nbsp; I was reckless.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Nonsense.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Don’t
dismiss it,” she countered tersely.&nbsp; “I was tactically reckless and
foolish, and it nearly cost you your life.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
but no one objected.&nbsp; If you were reckless and foolish then we are all
guilty of the same,” he said as he pulled his pants on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>But
I’m in command.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Of
course.&nbsp; Yes, you fucked up Kathryn, but only a little more than the rest
of us did.&nbsp; We won’t make the same mistake again, will we?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>So
what’s…” he pulled his shirt on over his head, temporarily muffling his ability
to speak, “what’s the new plan?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Overkill.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Felix raised an eyebrow at her.&nbsp; Having finished
dressing, he sat himself back on the body tray projecting out of the sarcophagus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We’re
going to pick up some of Molly’s scavengers to escort us before we try again.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Definitely
wise.&nbsp; We knew of the intel resource, we should have done that in the
first place.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Right,
then instead of just landing in the middle of the damn ruins, we’re going to
take both shuttles down and make a base camp by the water as near as we can to
the target site.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Both
shuttles?” he asked. “Is that wise?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It
will allow us to have a much larger landing party, and to split our resources
more productively.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Felix nodded to the side, indicating he didn’t necessarily
agree, but that he certainly understood the rationale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m
not going to allow what happened to you to happen to anyone else.&nbsp; We’ll
be armed, and we’ll have New Horizon in an overwatch position.&nbsp; We’ll do
it right this time.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Sounds
like a plan.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“…</span> and
you’re going to be our overwatch.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You’re
not coming this time.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh
come on Kat!&nbsp; Look, I’m fine now!&nbsp; And you’re going to need engineers
down there this time just as much as you did last time.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Felix.&nbsp;
You are a tremendous engineer.&nbsp; On Haven.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He frowned at her.&nbsp; “That hurts.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m
sorry, you’re right.&nbsp; I mean we’ll have to be doing excavating if we find
what we’re looking for and you’d certainly be very helpful with that, but
still.&nbsp; You’re not going.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s
not fair.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No,
probably not,” she responded with a sigh as she stood up.&nbsp; “But I’m in
command, and that’s how it’s gonna to be.&nbsp; You will stay here on the ship
with Irvina, Xion, and Teresa.&nbsp; You will telescope our position and monitor
in infra-red, and you will keep watch from orbit to make sure that what
happened to you doesn’t happen to anyone else.&nbsp; Everyone else will be down
on the surface.&nbsp; A pilot and guard will stay at each shuttle, and the rest
will be divided into two search teams.&nbsp; That’s how it’s going to be.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He was unhappy but eventually he shrugged it off.&nbsp;
“Well, someone’s gotta do it…” he remarked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He was a decimeter taller than her, and she put her hand up
onto his shoulder, then affectionately cradled the side of his face with her
hand as she smiled at him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn left the medical bay and the door shut behind
her.&nbsp; She paused, and wearily allowed her body to fall back against the
door and let her head rest back against it.&nbsp; She let out a long exhausted
sight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Is he
alright?” Jaren asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Her eyes shot open.&nbsp; She hadn’t even noticed him
there.&nbsp; He was sitting across the hall a few meters away, his chin resting
on his arms folded over his drawn up knees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh,
Jaren.&nbsp; Yeah, he… seems fine.&nbsp; He’s as surprised as anyone else at
how magical that sarcophagus seems.&nbsp; He asked if the attack was a dream…
you can’t tell he was attacked at all to look at his arms and leg.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
that chamber is… remarkable.”&nbsp; He was remarkably glum.&nbsp; “I’m glad
he’s alright.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They sat in silence facing each other as a slow but steady
procession of other crew members arrive and entered the medical bay to greet
Felix.&nbsp; They didn’t seem to pay Kathryn and Jaren much attention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It’s
my fault too,” Jaren offered.&nbsp; As a commander himself he could sense that
she was burdened with her sense of responsibility at what had happened.&nbsp;
“And you said yourself he’s good as new.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Maybe
we should wait,” she pondered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Wait?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
could report home what happened, have them assemble a more specialized team.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Captain.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We are
that specialized team.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She smiled despite herself.&nbsp; She had to admit that she
missed him.&nbsp; She wanted to sit beside him and let the weight on her
shoulders melt and drip down around her with him.&nbsp; But she wasn’t ready
for that yet.&nbsp; It was all still far too fresh a wound.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
should have brought more weapons,” she lamented as a general point of
observation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>In
retrospect yes, that would have been helpful.&nbsp; We have enough to manage
though.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Did
you mean what you said before about this all just being the beginning?” Jaren
asked.&nbsp; “About restoring Orbital One and establishing a colony and
research post here and all that?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
did…” she replied a little distantly, lost in the thought.&nbsp; “I love
Haven.&nbsp; I love our twin cities and our people and culture.&nbsp; It’ll
always be home, but… something about this place, despite the danger, despite
the challenges… still feels like coming home somehow.&nbsp; Do you feel that too?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Not
really,” he answered distantly.&nbsp; He wanted to tell her that being with her
was the most at home he’d ever felt in his life, and how much he longed to
return to that place, but it was obvious how poorly such a sentiment would be
received at present.&nbsp; “I do like it here thought, there is something about
it…&nbsp; I love Kobol and have a lot to miss there, but… still.&nbsp; I am
taken with this place, the mystery, the potential, the danger and wildness…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Captain,”
It stung Kathryn to hear him refer to her so officially, “if there’s a mission
to have a permanent presence here to research and rebuild, I want to be a part
of it.&nbsp; I’ve been looking for a new direction and I think I’ve found
it.&nbsp; I want to spend the rest of my career working on this project, on
rebuilding Earth.&nbsp; I think that once the announcement is made, there will
be a significant number of Koboli who will want to do their part.&nbsp; Many
won’t care of course, and most I’m sure won’t care enough to want to actually
help themselves, but some will, like me.&nbsp; Some will just be curious enough
to want to come see Earth with their own eyes.&nbsp; There really is something
about it…&nbsp; Something deep in our bones feels a connection to this place.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Have
you gotten word on when the announcement will be made?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He paused to look at her for a moment, it was almost
accusatory.&nbsp; “Soon,” he told her as he reached in his pocket for his
scroll in response to a notification tone sounding from it.&nbsp; Pulling it
apart and reading the message, he clarified: “very soon.”&nbsp; He looked up at
her.&nbsp; “We should gather everyone together.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn stood up and brushed off some of the dust which had
accumulated on her pants.&nbsp; She then crossed the hallway and offered her
hands to Jaren to help him up.&nbsp; He looked up at her quizzically for a
moment before accepting her assistance and climbing to his feet.&nbsp; “Thank
you,” he offered simply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It
hasn’t been for very long, but I shared in your lie.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yeah…”
Jaren affirmed heavily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I love
Felix like a brother, but I couldn’t tell him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>So I
get it.&nbsp; I get why you had to do what you did.&nbsp; I hate it, but I get
it.&nbsp; It’s hard for me to condemn you for something I’ve now participated
in myself.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren wisely said nothing and just listened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
still need to sort out and separate my feelings about what you did and what
your people did.&nbsp; It’s all still muddled up for me, but I think we’re
going to be okay, if you still want us to be.&nbsp; I still need some time,
but… I think it’ll just take some time at this point.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With that she moved to hug him and he accepted, putting his
hand on her head and holding it to his chest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All three crews were summoned to the conference room with
the large wall screen, and all were in attendance.&nbsp; No one knew what it
was about, but were told only that the Koboli government was making an official
statement which would be important to all of them.&nbsp; The Koboli crew had
their suspicions that it was about the virus and Earth, but couldn’t know for
sure, and couldn’t share their suspicions with anyone else.&nbsp; They were all
still sworn to secrecy themselves.&nbsp; As the transmission began coming in
followed by a brief flickering, the Koboli president appeared on the large wall
screen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Greetings.&nbsp;
This transmission was recorded on Kobol, and immediately transmitted by rift to
Roma, Kobol, and Earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>In the
beginning, God commanded Adam and Eve not eat from the tree of knowledge of
good and evil.&nbsp; Tempted by Satan, Eve ate of the tree, and thus burdened
us all with an original sin for which we can never atone, but for which we must
nevertheless perpetually strive against in an eternal Sisyphean struggle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Our
great Latter Day Saints religion was founded in the United States of America, a
nation born of its own original twin sins of slavery and genocide.&nbsp; For
hundreds of years that great nation struggled to live up to the promise of its
fundamental ideals, and muddled through the darkness trying to find a way to
atone for its original sins, knowing on some fundamental level that any sort of
redemption was certainly out of reach if not outright impossible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We on
Kobol are aware that those of Roma and Haven are suspicious of us, of our
generosity, of our good will.&nbsp; It is my heavy duty to inform you today,
that there is indeed a reason for this, and sadly it is not merely our nature
to be so generous.&nbsp; We too, have an original sin, a monstrosity in our
past which we struggle every day in our attempt to learn how we can atone for
it, knowing that on the same fundamental level as Adam and Eve and the United
States of America, such atonement can never really be fully realized.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
people of Roma and Haven were unable to understand our apparent lack of
interest in what happened to Earth, and much to their clear frustration.&nbsp;
Well the answer is simple, really.&nbsp; We had no need to wonder, because we
already knew.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Some
eighteen years after our launch from Earth, a conspiracy was hatched in secret
among a small group among the thousands aboard the Nephi.&nbsp; They developed
a sinister virus, constructed a rocket, and launched it back towards the
Earth.&nbsp; It took nearly eighty years for the rocket to return to Earth, and
it struck the surface, and infected the planet.&nbsp; Within a week most on
Earth were dead.&nbsp; Over the next weeks and months, most of the humans
elsewhere in the Solar System were dead as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>This
is obviously a horrific revelation, but I wish to stress that this was an
incredibly small faction of fanatics aboard the Nephi.&nbsp; After the launch,
the plot was uncovered, and a tribunal was convened to judge them, and all
involved were sentenced to death and ejected to space.&nbsp; We… would have
warned Earth of course, but in our zeal leaving the Earth we carefully excluded
any technological means of transmitting back and forth between us.&nbsp; We
were leaving the Earth specifically to avoid the… pollution of modern Earth culture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>As the
president of Kobol, speaking personally for myself, as well as for all of the
citizens of Kobol today, as well as for all of our forebearers all the way back
to the original inhabitants of the Nephi, I apologize. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>While
today we all carry the stain of guilt, none of us are personally guilty
ourselves, and I ask that you keep this in mind as you experience the urge to
judge us by association.&nbsp; Remember what we have done for you so far, the
reunion we have facilitated, the technology we freely share, and the aid we
continue to offer however we can.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Be
horrified.&nbsp; Be angry.&nbsp; Be spiteful.&nbsp; But when these impulses
finally wane, when the fever of hatred breaks and the wave crests, we will
still be here.&nbsp; We will still be here with outstretched arms, open hands,
and open hearts, still offering our warm help and love. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Thank
you.&nbsp; God bless us all.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren swivelled around in his chair to face the Roman and
Havenite crews.&nbsp; His right elbow was on his chair’s elbow rest and his
chin rested on his hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nobody spoke for what seemed like an eternity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
knew?” Teresa finally asked him.&nbsp; Jaren nodded slowly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Seemingly at a loss for any better response, Teresa stood up
and walked out of the room.&nbsp; One by one, others began to silently depart
to process in their own way, until all that were left were the Koboli crew
along with Kathryn and Felix.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Why
now?” Felix asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren shrugged with his hands.&nbsp; “There is no right time
for something like that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No I
mean, I get that they would wait to do this until they’d made contact with us
so they could admit it to all colonies at once, but why this moment
specifically, why not yesterday?&nbsp; Why not tomorrow?&nbsp; Why now?&nbsp;
There must be a reason…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Because
I found out,” Kathryn admitted to him.&nbsp; “Well, Elim found out in
researching the virus and he told me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>When?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Late
yesterday, while you were in the chamber.&nbsp; I wanted to tell you, but I
promised to keep quiet on the condition that they made this announcement
immediately instead of waiting any longer.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Looking utterly numb, Felix stood and left the room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That
could have gone worse,” Kathryn offered the Koboli crew.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Irvina shrugged.&nbsp; “It could have gone better.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It took Kathryn some time to track down where the others had
gone, but eventually she figured out that they’d taken one of the shuttles and
gone over to Orbital One.&nbsp; She took the other shuttle and headed over
there herself.&nbsp; After docking in the central hub she retraced their steps
and finally found them in the wrecked storefront which used to be the Space Outback
Bar &amp; Casino, which made sense once she saw the backpack with Molly’s head
attached to the top.&nbsp; Kathryn remembered her commenting earlier that her
long late lover had once been the owner and operator.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was dim in the bar.&nbsp; Main power was still down and
would continue to be until a crew resupplied and restarted the central fusion
power cores.&nbsp; Only some portable lights revealed her crewmates and the
condition of the bar.&nbsp; It seemed as though not a single piece of glass
remained intact in the entire place, and the ground crunched under her boots as
she walked in.&nbsp; The grand piano in the corner was smashed and a lot of the
booth seating about the place was torn up.&nbsp; She found herself wondering
how it had all happened.&nbsp; Did people go mad and just start looting and
ransacking when the apocalyptic extent of the sickness became clearer and
clearer?&nbsp; She wondered how she thought her own people would react to
something like that, how she herself might.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two crews were gathered around two round tables pushed
together in the middle of the bar, and she discovered that she was wrong.&nbsp;
There apparently was at least one piece of glass remaining intact, and they
were drinking out of one large liquor bottle, passing it around.&nbsp; They
seemed ambivalent about her showing up there.&nbsp; Noone welcomed her, but
nobody was willing to tell her she wasn’t welcome.&nbsp; When she took off her
jacket, set it over the back of a chair and sat down, Felix handed her the
bottle after a moment of hesitation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She looked the bottle over in the dim light and realized
that it was Havenite vodka.&nbsp; One of her crew must have brought it along
and been saving it for one reason or another.&nbsp; She took a drink from the
bottle and grimaced violently as the toxin burned her mouth and esophagus.&nbsp;
She was going to hand the bottle off, but thought better of it and took another
big gulp before handing it off to Keri as she put her other forearm to her
mouth to contain the drink as she swallowed it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She wasn’t sure if they were talking before she came in, but
nobody was saying anything now.&nbsp; Everyone was just staring glumly into
space, interrupted only by their turn to drink as it came.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Thoughts?”
Kathryn finally asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
should have told us,” Keri told her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Maybe…”
Kathryn nodded as she fiddled with an ancient coaster on the table.&nbsp;
“Maybe.”&nbsp; She let the word hang in the air for a while before
continuing.&nbsp; “Do you remember how they told us that they were monitoring
us for years before they made contact?” she asked Keri, who nodded.&nbsp; “They
said they did so because we were so close to reaching New Horizons on our
own.&nbsp; They knew how important it was to us to be able to do that for
ourselves, for our own esteem and sense of accomplishment.&nbsp; I only granted
them the same courtesy.&nbsp; It was less than a day that I knew and had to
keep their secret, and I told them I only would on the condition they made
their announcement immediately.&nbsp; I got them to reveal it themselves, but I
extended them the courtesy of being able to do it for themselves.&nbsp; I felt
I owed them that at least.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Several people shrugged, but nobody said anything positive
or negative about what she had to say.&nbsp; They seemed willing to accept her
reasoning, but still didn’t like it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>As for
them keeping that secret that long, as for judging them for doing it… I don’t
know.&nbsp; I’ve had more time to process than the rest of you have.&nbsp; If
you’re anything like me, it’s hard to blame them personally for what a small
faction did so long ago.&nbsp; What really hurts is the lying now, the
deception of keeping it from us since they made contact.&nbsp; At the same time
though… you’re all right of course.&nbsp; I was complicit in that too, so it’s
hard for me to judge them too harshly for that alone.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It’s
shocking what they did,” Teresa said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn nodded.&nbsp; “Yes… But it wasn’t them them, was
it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It
feels like it was…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
know, I know… I certainly felt that way with Jaren at first.&nbsp; If felt like
such a personal betrayal.&nbsp; But, it wasn’t them… and I hope you come around
to that as I have.&nbsp; His sin… their sin sorry, was only the lie.&nbsp; They
kept it from us as long as they did.&nbsp; They pretended they didn’t know what
happened to Earth, and that they just didn’t care to find out.&nbsp; That they
certainly are culpable for.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everyone around the table nodded angrily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It’s
hard to forgive them for that, I know… but from what I understand they always
intended to make that formal announcement at some point.&nbsp; You can argue
they waited too long, you can argue that they would have waited much longer if
they hadn’t been found out, but they certainly meant to tell us at some point,
and now they have, even if I forced their hand.&nbsp; And… well frankly, their
guilt over the whole thing has turned out pretty well for us&nbsp; all in the
end hasn’t it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most looked at her quizzically.&nbsp; “We’re here,” she
elaborated.&nbsp; “We wouldn’t be without them.&nbsp; We’re reunited.&nbsp; We
wouldn’t be without them.&nbsp; That means a lot to me, and I think it should
to you as well.&nbsp; In the final calculus that forgives a lot in my opinion.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
can’t just…” Molly tried to utter through her scroll.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Can’t
what Molly?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>They
committed genocide.&nbsp; That’s not something you just get over.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
people who did that Molly, I don’t intend to ever forget or forgive.&nbsp; We
need to keep an active hate for them I agree.&nbsp; We need to erect some kind
of monument or series of monuments to those who were lost, and in condemnation
of the perpetrators.&nbsp; We need a regular interplanetary day of memorial
across our worlds.&nbsp; We need all of that.&nbsp; This can never be
forgotten, and those who did it must never be forgiven.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Those
who did it…” the head said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s
right.&nbsp; As for the… well, latter day Latter Day Saints, despite myself I
keep putting myself in their position.&nbsp; I keep imagining being confronted
with people who are angry with something people ten generations removed from me
did, while I’m doing everything I can to help them in the present, just sucking
it up and taking their slings and arrows.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>They
are no saints,” Ana asserted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn smirked.&nbsp; As much as they may like to refer to
themselves as saints, they certainly weren’t.&nbsp; “No, they are certainly
not.&nbsp; But they are humans.&nbsp; Fallible, arrogant, individual humans,
just like us.&nbsp; They don’t deserve to be burdened with the sins of their
ancestors any more than we do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>So,”
she said as she stood up, “here it is.&nbsp; I choose to forgive them.&nbsp; I
don’t condone their lying, I don’t forgive what their ancestors did, but I
forgive them, as they are today, who they are today, for what they have done
today.&nbsp; I understand their reasons and their shame, and I forgive
them.&nbsp; None of you have to though, you can all feel however the hell you
want to.&nbsp; When we get home you can react however you want, feel however
you want to feel, and hate whoever you want to hate.&nbsp; But right now we’re
on a mission that you have all signed up for, and I expect you all to do your
duty until the job is done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’ll
give you a day to feel sorry for yourself, and then we are launching our second
search attempt to get Molly a new body.&nbsp; You have…” she checked her watch,
“twenty-eight hours until we launch.&nbsp; I expect you all to be well rested,
and I expect you all to be professional, and have your game faces on regardless
of how you feel about everything.”&nbsp; She took the bottle from Ana, took one
last drink before handing the bottle back, grabbed her jacket off the back of
her chair, and walked out of the ruined bar without interest in a response from
any of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Back on the New Horizon she found Jaren on the bridge.&nbsp;
He was reviewing surveillance video of the landing site, and she smiled at the
sight of him working given everything that was going on.&nbsp; She knew it was
a comfort for him to focus on the work; it was something they shared in
common.&nbsp; He noticed her enter, but didn’t say anything and looked back at
the screens.&nbsp; He was trying to respect her stated need for time and space.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She came up behind him and put her hands on his
shoulders.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without looking up at her he put his right hand up to
his left shoulder and took her hand.&nbsp; “How are they?” he asked.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>They’ll
work it out,” she answered.&nbsp; He nodded his understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>And
how are you?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She swiveled his chair around, and pulled him to his feet so
she could hug him.&nbsp; Their hug lingered as they slowly turned back and
forth, alone in the dim night time lighting of the bridge.&nbsp; She pushed
away from him, held him at arm’s length, and looked up into his eyes.&nbsp;
“Don’t ever lie to me again.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Never,”
he said with damp eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
don’t care if you’re bound by your job.&nbsp; We have to be past that point now
if we’re going to be together.”&nbsp; He simply nodded that he understood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>So is
there anything else you’re hiding?” she asked.&nbsp; “Any other big dark secret
you’re keeping that will make me hate you when I find out about it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He smiled as his eyes brightened.&nbsp; “No, there’s nothing
else.&nbsp; And it was killing me having to keep all of that from you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Good,”
she said.&nbsp; “I hope your suffering was absolutely horrific,” she teased him
with a smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At that he returned an awkward smile, and in response she
couldn’t resist kissing him.&nbsp; It was good to finally come home again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#8195;</p>

<h4 class=MsoNormal>Chapter 20</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Alright
Felix, how are we looking?” Kathryn asked, strapped into one of the shuttles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It’s a
beautiful spring morning in the abandoned ruins of the great city of
Vancouver,” Felix reported, feigning an overly stylized media presenter voice,
“highs of twenty eight, and not a cloud in the sky.&nbsp; It’s a beautiful day
to go sifting through dangerous ruins for a replacement body for your nearest
and dearest disembodied simulant head.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Thank
you Felix,” she replied, indicating she was adequately amused but not going to
indulge him any further.&nbsp; “Patricia, are your explorers standing by for us
to pick them up?”&nbsp; Both she and Molly’s head were in the shuttle with her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes
Kathryn, they are waiting at the location we departed from the other day.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Alright
then, take us down Jaren.&nbsp; Other shuttle, as discussed you will wait until
we’ve picked up the rest of our party, and then depart to meet us at our
designated landing coordinates.&nbsp; This shuttle will be designated Alpha,
yours will be Beta.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Understood
Alpha,” Irvina answered over the comms from the other shuttle.&nbsp; “We’ll see
you there.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teresa, Deirdre and Terey were left behind with Felix on New
Horizon while Kathryn, Patricia, Molly’s head and Jaren were the only ones
currently in Alpha Shuttle in order to accommodate the six explorers they were
going to pick up.&nbsp; This left Irvina, Reed, Xion, Nadelle, Francis, and Ana
standing by on the second shuttle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alpha Shuttle raced away from the New Horizon and Kathryn,
Patricia, and Molly took the opportunity to marvel yet again at the spectacular
view of the planet below the projection of the exterior onto the interior
surfaces of the shuttle provided, as Jaren focused on safely bringing the
shuttle down to Molly and Patricia’s village site.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They approached the ground remarkably quickly, to the point
that Kathryn could tell Patricia was becoming somewhat nervous before Jaren
severely decelerated the shuttle, and then slowed down more gently towards a
soft landing on the extended struts below the shuttle.&nbsp; The wall fell away
to present a ramp, and Patricia welcomed the local explorers onto the shuttle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Don’t
be afraid,” she told them, “they are friends.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The explorers seemed rather taken aback at the site of
Molly’s head sitting strapped into a seat above the sack her power source had
been mounted into.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Not to
worry boys, all part of the plan,” she reassured them as casually as she could
through her scroll speakers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The men looked at each other and shrugged before being led
over to their seats by Patricia, who assisted them to strap properly strap
themselves securely into their seat harnesses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>This
is a great honour,” Patricia assured them.&nbsp; “Not only will you be blessed
as I have to see the lands from the sky, but our task is to find a new body for
dear Leader and help her be restored.&nbsp; Isn’t that wonderful?”&nbsp; She
sounded genuinely honoured to be part of the effort.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The men didn’t seem much phased by the promise of a great
view, perhaps they didn’t fully understand what she’d meant, but they
brightened considerably and some of their tenseness seemed to dissipate upon
hearing what their primary objective was.&nbsp; They loved their dear leader,
and they knew how much Molly lamented what had happened to her body.&nbsp; The
prospect of helping her be restored seemed a great honour, and what an
unexpected additional blessing after only so recently being freed from her
imprisonment in the damn!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn couldn’t tell to what degree Jaren took relish in
terrifying their new passengers, but he seemed to take off and accelerate into
the sky somewhat faster than he usually would or needed to.&nbsp; The men
seemed on the verge of terror and when she saw the subtle smirk on Jaren’s face
she understood.&nbsp; She hadn’t herself, but Jaren certainly recognized two of
the men they’d brought onboard as ones who had been guarding Kathryn during his
botched rescue attempt.&nbsp; Worse still, one of them was clearly the one who
had cut her throat.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She’d already completely forgotten but Jaren clearly hadn’t,
and although she doubted he’d do anything else, he was taking this opportunity
to relatively innocently get back at them by making their ascent a little
harder on them than it needed to be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He climbed to a relatively high elevation, and signalled for
the other shuttle to begin their descent to the surface.&nbsp; Their shuttle
tilted to the side for a time as Jaren traversed the surface of the planet
before beginning to descend again.&nbsp; The area they’d designated this time
for landing and setting up camp was a relatively flat area on the water with a
mixed sandy and rocky beach leading up a gradual slope to a relatively open and
flat grassy area.&nbsp; Here there didn’t seem to be any danger of surface
instability, and it allowed them the opportunity to see any potential threats
coming their way before they fell upon them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How is
the fuel holding up Jaren?” Kathryn asked as she undid her shoulder
straps.&nbsp; The explorers began to do the same upon seeing her do so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Bout
half, other shuttle’s probably the same, so another four or five return trips.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>So if
we needed to spend a few days or more here we’d want to set up camp here as
opposed to going back up to the ship every night?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
although… it’s a lot less fuel to go to the northern encampment than to orbit,
if we’re welcome it might be best to spend the nights there if it comes to
that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
would be welcome,” Molly confirmed through the scroll.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn led the others down the ramp to wait for the other
shuttle, and they were immediately able to see its shiny exterior high up in
the sky, glittering in the morning sun.&nbsp; The all watched as it descended
and finally came down to a landing beside them, including Molly’s head who was
worn on the back of one of her men.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Irvina led the others out of Beta shuttle and nodded in
acknowledgement of her teammates.&nbsp; “Jaren, Captain.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Irvina,”
Kathryn acknowledged.&nbsp; “We were discussing that for the sake of fuel, if
we need to spend several days or more here we’d be better off staying at
Molly’s village as opposed to returning to orbit.&nbsp; If it looks like we’ll
be spending weeks though, we’ll have to set up a formal camp.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Forgive
me Captain, but if this is really going to take weeks then we are going to have
to return to Kobol and resupply.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Good
point.&nbsp; Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.”&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Irvina nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Ok,
Molly’s explorers please gather around.”&nbsp; Kathryn fully deployed one of
the large scrolls and laid it on the ground so they could all stand around and
see, though she squatted down to manipulate it with touch control.&nbsp; She
looked up at the men though, and detected a sense of unease.&nbsp; “How are you
all by the way, did you enjoy the flight?&nbsp; Must have been pretty exciting
if it was your first time in the air?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The men mumbled that they were well and that yes it had
indeed been something to travel in a flying machine.&nbsp; They hardly had the
language to even refer to what they had just experienced.&nbsp; She got the
sense that they now just wished to get on with the mission and she was happy to
oblige.&nbsp; “This… is a true aerial image of this peninsula.&nbsp; Molly
tells me you’ve all been here exploring for equipment and supplies you can
still use, that you’ve all been here at least once?”&nbsp; Some grunts and
definitive nodding answered in the affirmative for her.&nbsp; “Right.&nbsp;
Well, this is a road map overlay of the peninsula from the archives.&nbsp; As
you can see, the gulleys generally map onto the ravines between the hills, but
not perfectly.&nbsp; This general area,” she pointed, “is where Mol-, I mean your
leader, says we might be able to find a place with things we may be able to
restore her with.&nbsp; Can you lead us there?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The men nodded while one stroked his chin pensively.&nbsp;
“Hills… unstable, but inside the hills are the best place to find valuables, but
very dangerous to enter.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
we figured.&nbsp; We have engineers who can assess structural integrity, and we
have some equipment which should help when we need to enter one.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The men looked at her blankly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How do
you suggest we proceed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Safest
way is along the water, cave ins less likely, but more vulnerable to murdercat
attack.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,”
Kathryn acknowledged as she stood and pushed the scroll closed.&nbsp; “We know
that much.&nbsp; What is the best way to avoid the, um… murdercats?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Luck?”
the one man offered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Right.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>If we
spot one,” he held up his blow dart, “we will try to stop it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Thank
you,” she said.&nbsp; “We have weapons too.&nbsp; If you alert us we can attack
along with you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The man nodded his understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>So,
cave ins, murder cats, the occasional bear… anything else we need to worry
about?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Explorers
from other tribes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
encounter them often?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Often,
yes… but not always.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Do you
ever get along?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Sometimes
we make brothers.&nbsp; Usually we make war.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Which
do you prefer?” she asked.&nbsp; They looked at her as though they didn’t
understand the question, which she figured was fair enough. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Alright,
everyone listen up.&nbsp; Here’s the plan.&nbsp; We walk in twos, two explorers
in the front, two in the middle, two in back.&nbsp; The rest of you pair off
and find yourself a place in line.&nbsp; Person on the left watch your left, on
the right watch your right.&nbsp; One of you look out for threats above and
around, the other focus more on the terrain ahead of and beneath you.&nbsp;
Everyone clear?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They all formed into a line two by two and crossed the field
towards the wasteland of once mighty skyscrapers and streets.&nbsp; Kathryn
couldn’t shake the feeling of tiptoeing through a graveyard as they entered a
covered area.&nbsp; Once in the city, a variety of leafy and evergreen trees
quite thoroughly obscured the sky, and between the trees and the moss and
grasses on the ground, everything she could see had a distinct emerald green
hue to it.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As they walked along a creek the terrain was not forgiving.&nbsp;
It was not a path they were traversing, it was wild land, with a deep ravine on
one side of them and a steep slope going up the other.&nbsp; She knew that the
hills were the remains of collapsed buildings, but only now did she realize
that the creek on her other side was the remains of an underground tunnel under
the roadway that used to exist there, now long caved in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She tried to picture what this place must have looked like
once.&nbsp; She imagined walking along a concrete sidewalk with a towering
structure shooting up into the sky beside her, covered in glass and glittering
in the morning sun.&nbsp; She imagined it must have been something like what
she’d seen in the capital city on Kobol.&nbsp; She tried to imagine seeing cars
of all sorts zooming by her on one side, subway trains rumbling
underfoot…&nbsp; Her dreams of restoring Earth were not so grandiose or
imperial as to want to exactly replicate in this space what had once been, but
she found herself longing to be able to walk down this street for real, to know
this city and its people as they had been, to know this world and its culture
at its height.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It reminded her of home, although home was several hundred
years of technological development behind Earth at the time of the plague, it
occurred to her that Earth at some point in its past must have looked quite a
bit like Haven did now, at least in the twin city.&nbsp; She imagined hundreds
of years before the plague, her ancestors just coming to grips with the
relationship between electricity and magnetism, and developing the early
rocketry which would take them up to…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She’d stopped dead in her tracks, and the rest of the party
was looking at her expectantly.&nbsp; Some looked up into the sky to try to see
what she was looking at, but they couldn’t.&nbsp; From her perspective, a hole in
the canopy of the forest serendipitously showed through the full moon as seen
during daytime, a pockmarked blue white circle begging contemplation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In that moment she understood something profound.&nbsp; The
whole time her people had been on Haven, they had looked up in the sky and seen
the New Horizon up there, waiting for them to return.&nbsp; Its presence there
almost taunted them, derided them for having lost the ability to return and
dared them to attempt it again.&nbsp; Haven had no large moon, only New
Horizon, but seeing that moon from this planet, she understood that it must
have elicited a very similar taunting to the people of Earth, that it must
still today to the survivors.&nbsp; It demands notice, demands explanation and
exploration, an ever-present challenge just out of reach up in the celestial
sphere.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She knew a kinship with her ancestors in that moment, the
first of many such moments, but the first would always be the most
profound.&nbsp; She was able to directly relate something of her Haven
experience to something of the experience of Earth, and that moment of
recognition brought her to some sort of spiritual closeness with her deep roots
as a human being.&nbsp; It was her first sense of truly deep connection, her
first profound moment of deep understanding about of the ultimate unity of all
human beings on all four worlds, they were not Havenites, Kobolians, Romans,
and Earthlings, they were all just humans with different addresses, an extended
family separated for too long.&nbsp; They were one collective force in the universe
divided only in their minds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What’s
up?” Irvina asked beside her.&nbsp; “Problem?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No, no
problem…&nbsp; Sorry, let’s continue.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Periodically they would find that the path they wanted to
take was simply insurpassable.&nbsp; The hill too steeply gave way directly
into the ravine, or they wanted to go one direction but could only go the
other, and getting to where they wanted to go even just a few kilometers in
from their landing site required a lot of backtracking and careful route
planning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They didn’t complain, but Kathryn was getting the sense that
this was not how the explorers were used to operating, that they tended to
reach the outskirts, and enter the first hill which presented promise and
opportunity.&nbsp; Regardless, their experience was proving quite useful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn and Irvina were directly behind the lead two
explorers, and one casually fell back to walk with the two women.&nbsp; “We are
being watched,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>By
what?” Irvina asked.&nbsp; “From where?”&nbsp; The man pointed, but the two
women could not see anything.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>They
are rival explorers, but we cannot tell from which people.&nbsp; We can’t say
how dangerous.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn touched her PANEs.&nbsp; “Taking a nap
Overwatch?&nbsp; Lead explorers report possible hostiles to the west.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Scanning…”
Felix reported.&nbsp; “Sorry Captain, yes indeed.&nbsp; A dozen targets… one
point two kilometers west south west.&nbsp; Patching infra-red into your
PANEs.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Wow,”
Kathryn said, startled to the point that she had to stop walking, so the whole
party did as well.&nbsp; Now instead of what was in front of her, all she could
see in her glasses was the red scanning map from orbit.&nbsp; She lifted the
glasses up and rested them on the top of her head, and pulled a pocket scroll
out of her pocket.&nbsp; She opened it up and muttered: “there’s got to be a
more effective way to display… yes, there we go.”&nbsp; She tapped a few more
times at the panel and then rolled it up and tucked it back in her
pocket.&nbsp; “Much better…” she uttered as she pulled the glasses back down
over her eyes.&nbsp; Now instead of the orbital imaging, she had the proper view
out in front of her, but with targets marked with cursors off in the distance,
superimposed on the true image.&nbsp; She was seeing every large heat signature
besides their party through the glasses, complete with a range indicator above
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Setting
F7B on your PANEs if you’ve got them,” she called back down the line.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the lead explorers grabbed her arm.&nbsp; “Waneta,”
he warned.&nbsp; “I saw their colours, they are Waneta.&nbsp; We are in
danger.&nbsp; If we have seen them they are already planning to attack!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How do
they attack?&nbsp; What is the best defence?” she asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>They
circle, attack from all sides.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Looking all about her in every direction she could see
figures slowly making their way into an encircling formation.&nbsp; “Is there
any way to deter their attack, to make them reconsider?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>They
have never been seen without suffering attack,” he explained, obviously quite
concerned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Weapons?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Swords,
darts.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Damn,”
Kathryn exclaimed, turning to Irvina.&nbsp; “We don’t have the space here to
get into a defensive formation against an encircling attack.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I have
a really bad idea…” Irvina offered, looking up the slope immediately beside
them towards a clearing at the top of the hill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It’s a
good idea,” Kathryn considered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Unless
we all fall into a cave in and break our necks.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No
more likely than being hacked to bits if we don’t,” she said with a
shrug.&nbsp; “Oh hell, they’re almost in formation.&nbsp; Everyone up the
hill!!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some seemed to hesitate or start to protest, but when they
saw Kathryn and Irvian along with the two lead explorers all bolt at full speed
up the hill they all sensed the urgency and followed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
head at the very top of the hill, New Horizon crew on your bellies facing out
with weapons drawn, explorers out front!&nbsp; Stick to the ground at distance
but if they get close enough, up on your feet for defence against swords!”
Kathryn yelled as she arrived at the top of the hill first and got into
position, quickly followed by all the others who obeyed her instructions
without question and all properly got into formation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What’s
your name?” Kathryn asked as she tapped on the boot of the explorer in front of
her who had warned her about the Waneta.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Kirby.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Kirby
will they stop if they’re getting killed?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>They
would consider it a dishonour.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
understand.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A dart she never saw whistled past her ear. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Balls!!”
Molly cried out from the scroll in the bag below her.&nbsp; “Those
bastards!&nbsp; My one good eye!!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn looked back to see a dart embedded in poor Molly’s
one eye, moving about with her eye as she moved it by looking around in
disbelief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Despite the stress of the situation, or maybe because of it,
Kathryn couldn’t help but let out a mirthful grunt at the sight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It’s
NOT FUNNY!” Molly yelled angrily at her, glaring at her with the dart pointed
squarely at her in line with her stare.&nbsp; This of course only made it
funnier, but the moment was broken when she saw one of the infra-red cursors
manifest into direct line of sight, and she raised her printed handgun, took
aim at his chest and fired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She rarely missed, and this time was no exception.&nbsp;
They all tried to storm them at once from all directions, but under Kathryn’s
instructions they were ready for them.&nbsp; Before long they were all taken
out long before they reached a range at which they could use their swords.&nbsp;
Those who were shot were quickly dying if not dead already, and those who had
been darted or struck by an energy blast from the Kobol wands were soundly
unconscious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nobody seemed in a hurry to get back up to their feet after
the event.&nbsp; Kathryn tapped Kirby’s boot and asked: “What happens when the
ones still alive wake up?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>If we
are gone, they will leave.&nbsp; If they see us they will attack again.&nbsp;
They claim these entire ruins for themselves.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
see.&nbsp; And how long will your darts knock them out?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Half a
daytime,” he answered.&nbsp; She figured that meant four hours at least and
probably no more than six.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Is
anyone hurt?” she called out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes!!”
Molly cried out indignantly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Besides
Molly?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nobody else called anything else out.&nbsp; Cautiously
Kathryn pushed herself up onto her knees and dusted her hands before standing
up and walking over to Molly’s head.&nbsp; She put her fists on her hips and
looked down at her sympathetically as her eye along with its embedded dart
looked up at her in return.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Pull
it out?” Kathryn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh
no,” Molly answered sarcastically.&nbsp; “I like it this way.&nbsp; I think it
might start a fashion trend.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Alright,”
Kathryn sighed.&nbsp; “Hold still,” she advised as she bent down and put one
hand on the top of Molly’s head to stabilize it, and as gingerly as possible
slipped the dart out.&nbsp; Molly blinked her eye furiously several times and
then looked up at Kathryn gratefully.&nbsp; “Are you damaged?” she asked the
head.&nbsp; “Can you still see?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Surprisingly…
yes,” she answered through the scroll in the bag below her.&nbsp; “It must have
just missed the important optics.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Good.&nbsp;
Alright, well we’d better WHOA!!”&nbsp; The whole hill most of them were still
laying down on gave way and slumped, falling straight down, then stopped, then
fell again, and then fell again, about two meters each time.&nbsp; Kathryn was
just barely able to keep her footing the whole time and stayed on her feet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
was that??” she asked anyone able to answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Cascade
collapse,” Irvina answered, carefully getting to her feet. “The top floor fell
onto the lower one, both of which collapsed onto the lower floor, and the
next.&nbsp; We’re lucky we didn’t fall through.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Why
didn’t we?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Probably
too much debris and soil ontop of the top floor, the weight was easier to
accommodate by collapsing floors of the original structure than to have
something fall through.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Right.”&nbsp;
Kathryn knelt down to address the head.&nbsp; “Molly, you’re gonna have to help
us out.&nbsp; You said once you were on the ground you’d be able to guide
us.&nbsp; Are any intuitions striking you?&nbsp; We’ve been wandering around
too long, can you help us out?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m
sorry, nothing looks anything like…” she looked around, “what it did before.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Patricia approached.&nbsp; “If you could see inside one of
these ruins, could it help you more precisely locate yourself?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s
an interesting idea girl.&nbsp; It might.&nbsp; A lot of these buildings were
residential and I wouldn’t recognize, but a lot of the residential buildings
had businesses on the main floor I might recognize.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn sighed, but then addressed Irvina and Francis.&nbsp;
“What is the safest and easiest way to get into an interior of one of these
hills?” she asked the engineers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Safest?”
Francis asked.&nbsp; “There may be an easiest way, but there is no safe way.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Fine.&nbsp;
Suppose we wanted to get into this structure specifically, how would you do
it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>This
hill we’re on?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
one that just collapsed several floors?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes.”&nbsp;
She could tell he wanted to simply state that he wouldn’t want to, but he
declined to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’d
take detailed orbital ground penetrating scans and assess the least
terrifyingly dangerous level and try to tunnel in from the side.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn turned to the explorers.&nbsp; “What about you
all?&nbsp; You must get into old buildings to scavenge, how do you do it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Sometimes
there are holes leading into them from the water.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Sometimes
there are…” she shook her head in disbelief.&nbsp; “You see?” she scolded
Francis.&nbsp; “That’s why we brought them with us!&nbsp; Let’s split up into
three teams, each led by a pair of explorers, and see if they can find us an
entrance into a building, any building.”&nbsp; She touched the side of her
PANEs.&nbsp; “Felix, we’re going to need you to watch us very carefully, we’re
temporarily splitting up.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She assigned who was on which team, and allowed Kirby to
lead Irvina, Ana, and herself down into one of the creek gulleys and follow the
water along, looking for a cave in the wall which they claimed might lead them
into a building.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Teams
be warned,” Francis said over the comms to all three of the groups, “there is a
herd of large animals moving through one of the ravines near you.&nbsp; They
appear from the descriptions offered by the locals to be a herd of the
herbivores they called deer.&nbsp; Still no sign of any threatening animals.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Here,”
Kirby said.&nbsp; He was pointing to an oval opening about a meter across which
had a modest but steady stream of liquid running out of the bottom of it, down
the rest of the wall, and into the stream.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh I
see, thanks.”&nbsp; She touched her PANEs.&nbsp; “Be advised teams, what Kirby
has shown me I think is a drainage tunnel where the water that seeps into the
building drains out into the ravines.&nbsp; We’re going to check it out.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Send
one of mine,” she heard Molly strongly suggest over the comms.&nbsp; “That’s
what they’re here for.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn paused and considered.&nbsp; She wanted to go
herself, and if it was just a matter of putting someone else’s life at risk
instead of her own she wouldn’t have considered it, but the reality was that
they were indeed much more experienced in this and would more readily
understand the dangers they would find.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Alright,
here Kirby,” she took off her PANEs and put them on his face.&nbsp; These will
allow you to see in the dark and send what you see back to this,” she said of
the scroll she took out her pocket.&nbsp; “Just try not to touch it though, you
might make it do something you don’t want.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kirby looked somewhat concerned at her wording.&nbsp; Might
it blow up on his face if he touched it the wrong way?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Just
go in and have a look around.&nbsp; Your leader will see what you see and be
able to tell if she recognizes anything.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The man nodded, and bravely squeezed into the hole.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Kathryn,
heads up.&nbsp; I see what I think to be one of those murdercats in the
area.&nbsp; I think it’s stalking those deer, but its close enough that it…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What?&nbsp;
Talk to me Felix.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It’s
veered off.&nbsp; I think it’s heading in your direction.&nbsp; It looks like
it’s looking for an appropriate perch to look down on you, opposite side of the
ravine from you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I see
it,” Kathryn said with a devious smile, drawing her gun and relishing the
chance for some payback against the beast that had hurt her friend.&nbsp; It
didn’t seem to matter to her whether or not it was actually the same animal or
not.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The creature was hiding remarkably effectively in a tree,
but its eyes gave it away when she looked right at it.&nbsp; She raised her gun
and carefully took aim right between those two devilish eyes.&nbsp; But before
she could squeeze the trigger, the life left its eyes and it seemed to fall out
of the tree and out of sight.&nbsp; She looked over and saw that Irvina had
rendered it unconscious with her wand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Irvina was confused by the impression Kathryn’s expression
gave her that she’d done something wrong, but Kathryn merely thanked her
politely and that was the end of it.&nbsp; She went back to her scroll to
monitor Kirby’s progress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was hard to make out exactly what was seen, especially
with the red and black infra-red scanner image, but what could be seen was
remarkably well preserved.&nbsp; Very little within was actually preserved of
course, but the overall structure, the walls and such, were still intact.&nbsp;
What the room used to be however, was practically impossible to tell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
found another entrance,” Xion reported over the comms, “we’re going to send one
of our guides in, we’ll feed you all of the raw video directly.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Thanks
for your help Kirby, you can come on out now,” Kathryn called into the black
void as she brought up the other one’s feed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We’ve
found another one here too,” Jaren said from the third team.&nbsp; “Want us to
send someone in?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Wait
until we’ve checked out this second one.&nbsp; No need to risk yours till we’ve
checked that one out.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Understood.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Everyone
watched as one of Kirby’s colleagues slipped into the drainage way and shimmied
his way through the darkness.&nbsp; He finally emerged into a much larger
though still not terribly large open room with pillars holding up the
ceiling.&nbsp; He spotted an entry way into a larger area and they watched as
he proceeded into it.&nbsp; The second area must have been too large and open
for his scanners to be able to pick anything up, and Kathryn listened as Xion
explained in warning to the explorer that they were going to remotely activate
the little lights on his PANEs and amplify the light he would see in his
lenses, and on their remote viewing as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When they did so, a large cavernous area was revealed, and
something about it seemed very familiar to Kathryn, but she couldn’t
immediately identify what it was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It
looks like the main central area from Orbital One,” Felix commented on the feed
from up in orbit.&nbsp; From what she’d seen remotely of the station he was
right, but that wasn’t it…&nbsp; She snapped her fingers.&nbsp; “Yes, and a
larger configuration of the New Horizons dining hall as well!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was a large open area extending into the distance, with
elevated walkways on either side on top of a series of open spaces along the
main level such as the explorer had emerged from.&nbsp; The place was awash in
debris, and in a number of places the upper walkway had collapsed into the
spaces below, but all in all it was all remarkably intact.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
know what else it looks like?” Kathryn heard Molly say.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh my
god I don’t believe it!&nbsp; I recognize it, I know that place all too well!”
she laughed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
is it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It’s
the mall!&nbsp; My mall!” she laughed again.&nbsp; “It’s the damn Commonwealth
Pacific Mall!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>And
does that help us?” Kathryn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Sure
does!&nbsp; I spent way too much time and money in that place, and from there I
can definitely direct you to where the simulant laboratory should be.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh
thank goodness,” Kathryn exclaimed in relief.&nbsp; “Alright, get that man out
of there and let’s meet up again to plan a route to the lab.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Warning
Kat,” Felix communicated from high in the sky.&nbsp; “I see nine creatures
headed your way from the east north east.&nbsp; They look a little different
from the cat and they sure aren’t moving in a friendly way if you catch my
drift.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Nine
of them?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s
right.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Good
grief.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Inside,”
Kirby said, pointing to the hole.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Why?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Inside!”
he insisted.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn didn’t protest and pushed her way into the small
opening in the Earth, and the other four followed behind her.&nbsp; As she
moved she called to the other two teams.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Converge
on our position, I have a feeling we may need your help.&nbsp; Be careful
though, and advance with caution.&nbsp; Don’t let them get too close unless you
have the clear advantage.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She tripped and fell into the open area, and Irvina tripped
over her and fell to the ground as well.&nbsp; They managed to scramble out of
the way to avoid the other three following close behind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Light?”
Kirby asked, and Kathryn unrolled the scroll and set it to beacon mode, both
sides of the screen lit up remarkably brightly, and the whole area they found
themselves in lit up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Weapons.”
Kirby said, pointing to the hole they had just come out of, and she
understood.&nbsp; He had forced the animals into a bottleneck if they wanted to
come for them, and that is exactly what they seemed to have in mind. &nbsp;Ana
was unarmed, but Kathryn with her gun, Irvina with her wand, and the two
explorers with their blow darts took turns putting down wolves one after
another as they came through, but the third one managed to get by them,
shelterd from their attacks by the bodies of the previous two.&nbsp; In their
panic the fourth one came through, but the explorers, having survived such an
attack before, kept targeting the wolves in the tunnel until their still bodies
plugged the hole too tightly for any more to push their way through.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The women frantically danced about trying to avoid being
bitten by the two which had made it in.&nbsp; Irvina relative quickly put down
one of them with her wand, but Kathryn was too afraid of hitting one of her
teammates if she wildly shot at the remaining one in the small space.&nbsp;
Instead when it came for her she reared back and kicked it square in the jaw as
hard as she could, and knocked it back as it let out a yelp of pain.&nbsp; She
then advanced on it and kicked it several more times in the head before finally
stomping it as hard as she could several time, crushing its skull to be sure
that it was dead in a horrible bloody mess.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Completely lit up with pulsing adrenaline she turned back to
the others and frantically yelled in excited anger tinged with frustration, “is
EVERYTHING on this fucking planet trying to KILL US!!??”&nbsp; She breathed
heavily, her chest heaving in and out with the excitement in her veins and the
sudden exertion of energy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Nope,”
Irvina answered with a smirk and a twinkle in her eye, also quite excited and
worked up but nowhere near as much as Kathryn, who had just gotten so up close
and personal with the predator.&nbsp; “Only the things that aren’t afraid of
us.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From both sides of the narrow access tunnel, wolf bodies
were removed from the clog of flesh now blocking the passage between the
outside and interior of the ruin.&nbsp; When the last was pulled out, Jaren was
the first through.&nbsp; He asked if everyone was alright, but the burning
inquiry in his eyes was pointed squarely on Kathryn. &nbsp;Clearly he was most
interested in her well-being first, but out of consideration and responsibility
had to ask more generally of everyone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We’re
fine,” Irvina answered him, choosing not to be offended by his clear primary
interest in Kathryn.&nbsp; “Pretty lucky to be actually.”&nbsp; She did her
best to brush dust and dirt off of her pants, but not meeting with much
luck.&nbsp; “Captain Barnes here turns out to be quite a beast, I’m impressed!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn looked at Jaren with an expression meant to convey
that she was quite fine and that he needn’t worry.&nbsp; “What do we do with
these dead wolves?” she asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
normally use the skins and eat their meat,” Kirby answered.&nbsp; “But if we
leave them here, they will be consumed by other animals.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Alright,
let’s just do that then. &nbsp;Everyone else is outside?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Good,
we can all head to the final site together.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn made her way through the tunnel and greeted the rest
of the teams on the other side.&nbsp; Some offered handshakes, others embraced
her in lingering hugs before she could offer anything less.&nbsp; She turned
one of Molly’s men around to address the head sitting on top of the backpack.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>So,
based on what you saw in there you think you can direct us to the lab where you
were built?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
absolutely.&nbsp; Now that I have my bearings and understand better that these
ravines were streets and such, yes.&nbsp; It’s actually not very far from
here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Okay,
where do we head.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
the direction you’re looking two blocks, then turn right for three blocks and
its right there.&nbsp; Er… well, that’s where it used to be anyways.&nbsp; Now
I’m really nervous that we won’t find anything other than useless debris and
wreckage.&nbsp; Before we go there there is hope, but if we find nothing… then
all hope is gone.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn nodded that she understood.&nbsp; “We felt the same
way when we came back to Earth not knowing if we’d even find any still living
humans, let alone…” she looked at Jaren for a moment, then declined to finish
her thought.&nbsp; “Okay, where’s Kirby?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kirby was just poking his head through the entrance to the
ruins as he emerged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Kirby,
you’re my guy.&nbsp; You take point and lead us over there please.&nbsp; Your
leader says where we need to go is two blocks that way,” she extended her arm
to convey the direction, and then three blocks that way,” she bent her arm and
pointed with her finger to indicate the cross direction.&nbsp; “Same two by two
configuration we initially took.&nbsp; Felix, you have eyes on us?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes
ma’am, things look clear for several kilometers around you.&nbsp; The remaining
wolves seem to have gone back to wherever they came from, and none of the
survivors from the tribe that attacked have moved at all so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;
You’re clear to move on.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so they did, with Kathryn following Kirby and his fellow
local.&nbsp; The serenity of the location resumed its deceptive quality.&nbsp;
Birds chattered and playfully fluttered through the tree tops above their head,
and animals they could never quite get a look at fluttered about in the ravine
below, seemingly hard at work with the business of survival in the wild.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ravine water was only a little less than waist deep and
although it had a minor flow to it, it was soft enough that when they needed to
cross from one island city block to another, they could relatively easily climb
down the embankment on one side, wade through the water, and climb back up the other
side to resume their hike.&nbsp; The only variable of consequence was how
easily the embankments lent themselves to traverse.&nbsp; Sometimes they could
directly engage where they’d approached and wanted to cross, other times they’d
have to make their way quite an irritatingly far distance up or down stream to
find a section more suitable for crossing.&nbsp; This and the lack of a beaten
down path along the banks of the water ways made for frustratingly slow going.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally though, they came to an embankment adjacent to the
area where Molly had indicated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Does
every ruin block have an entrance like we saw at the other mounds?” Kathryn
asked Kirby.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>If you
look hard enough, yes.&nbsp; There will always be at least one drainage hole,
though they are often not large enough for us to pass through.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
see.&nbsp; Have you ever tried to dig such a passage larger?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Only
once.&nbsp; We lost two brothers that day.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
understand.&nbsp; Okay,” she forcefully called out after turning around to
address the rest of her party.&nbsp; “Fan out!&nbsp; Get in the water and look
all around the base of this mound for an entrance like we’ve seen before.&nbsp;
Kirby says there’s got to be one, but it may be too small to enter.&nbsp; We’ll
deal with that if and when we need to, but first we need to find it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the teams spread out they investigated the entire
perimeter.&nbsp; It didn’t take long before Ana called out that she’d found
something.&nbsp; Kathryn joined the others in looking at the hole in the side
of the ravine somewhat dubiously.&nbsp; It was narrow, too narrow, well… just
barely wide enough for some unlucky soul to shimmy their way through it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’ve
got just the thing,” Irvina offered as she pulled off her backpack and rummaged
through it.&nbsp; She produced something like a cube a quarter meter
across.&nbsp; “This is a multi-form drone, it can convert to a helicopter form,
or like this.”&nbsp; She placed the cube at the mouth of the hole and pointed
her wand at it.&nbsp; The cube deconstructed itself into the shape of a
segmented snake and began slithering down the hole.&nbsp; “It has a video feed
you can all access, its band theta four, unencrypted.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn processed this and then, realizing she could pick up
the feed on her PANEs pulled them out of her pocket and put them on, using her
pocket scroll to switch them to the channel Irvina had indicated.&nbsp; She was
still marvelling somewhat at the utility of the device, watching through its
eyes as it worked its way into the interior.&nbsp; It seemed that the hole was
about six meters long, but maintained the same narrowness the entire length if
maybe getting a touch wider the further in the drone slithered.&nbsp; Finally
the snake reached the end and waited ahead of the soil mound in front of it on
the floor below for further instruction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I’m
going to switch it to flight mode and set it on an automatic search and scan mode,”
Irvina explained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The drone folded back up into a cube, and then configured
itself into a flat triangle with mini antimatter thrusters at each point, and
then got to work mapping the accessible interior.&nbsp; Kathryn watched the
video feed, but then put the image onto the top left of both lenses so she
could keep an eye on it while she went to talk to Molly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
do you think?” she asked the head, who was watching on a scroll one of her men
was holding up in front of her immobile head so she could see.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Hard
to make out…” she admitted.&nbsp; “I’m certain we’ve got the right building,
but… this area appears to be an empty large area… oh, right!&nbsp; This is the
parking garage for the Road Pods in the basement of the building.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
are Road Pods?” Kathryn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,
they were pods which uh… travelled on the road,” Molly awkwardly
answered.&nbsp; “They were a primary component of our transportation
infrastructure, you just get in, think at it where you want to go and it would
take you there, charging your accounts for its use when you were finished with
it,” she explained.&nbsp; “This was one of any number of storage lots where
Road Pods not currently in use would sit idle, waiting for the next
summons.&nbsp; It also doubled as a parking area for the few weirdos who still
had antique vehicles which required a driver, as well as those wealthy enough
to afford their own private fancy pod.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
see.&nbsp; What should be above this level?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Ummm…”
Molly’s head looked up into the sky with its one eye, searching for the
answer.&nbsp; “As I recall… the level above this was ground entrance
commercial, shops and restaurants which opened onto the street for pedestrian
traffic and, of course, anyone arriving from below in Road Pods.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>And
the simulant laboratory?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Three
or four floors above that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Three,
or… four,” Kathryn repeated, dismayed with her inability to be more specific.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Felix?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How
can I help?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Molly
says that the level the drone is currently in is a basement level, above that
was street entrance commercial and the lab three or four floors above.&nbsp;
What can the ground penetrating sensors show of the internal structure of this
particular mound?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Hold.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn waited with Molly looking right at her.&nbsp; She
didn’t have the luxury of turning her head away, but also seemed content to
continue to stare at her as though she were assessing her, surveying her, for
some reason trying to absorb every feature of her appearance, while Kathryn was
politely trying to look elsewhere.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>If
this doesn’t work out,” Molly finally said, still looking unblinkingly at
Kathryn, “it’ll take a long time for the Mormons to figure out and perfect
simulant technology, but eventually if they keep at it they should be able to
create for me any kind of form I’d like.&nbsp; I always imagined I’d like to
have my original form restored, but I’ve been daydreaming since you all showed
up with so much promise and possibility for me.&nbsp; I could be a woman of any
appearance I could want, I could custom order any kind of beauty I want.&nbsp;
I could have yours!” she exclaimed with a mischievous smile, to which Kathryn
frowned quite profoundly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh not
to worry child, I know that would be unfair, especially with you humans aging
the way you insist on doing… or hey, I could be a man!”&nbsp; The novelty
seemed to initially tantalize her, but she quickly changed her expression to
one of dismissal of the idea.&nbsp; “No, no I don’t suppose I’d like that at
all.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
suppose if you didn’t want to, there’s no reason why you’d have to look entirely
like a human at all,” Kathryn offered, keeping the conversation going while
they waited.&nbsp; “You might discover a form that suited you even better than
a human one.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>This
is true, why I never thought of that, but you’re right aren’t you?&nbsp; Why I
could be a three meter tall bronze skinned monster with laser eyes!&nbsp; Or I
could be an angel with large beautifully delicate wings, or could be a barrel
chested silver robot with arms and legs like robotic elephant trunks or
something, anything I want!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
would imagine so, yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Hunh…
when I was made, back in the day… the whole point of simulants was to replicate
living humans as precisely as possible.&nbsp; That was the pride in them, how
indistinguishable they were from the real thing.&nbsp; It never became in
fashion to make things deliberately unreal… though I suppose eventually we’d
have gotten there.&nbsp; We made everything from house cats, to dinosaurs with
human minds in them, to toy elephants the size of cats… that was about as
imaginative as the builders got before the fall.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Okay
I’ve run the scans,” Felix said over the comms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>And?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>And…
there is nothing above the first floor.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Molly looked down and away in disappointment for the first
time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Explain,”
Molly commanded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It
looks as though most of the top of the buildings broke off and fell away long
ago like all the others, and they are all in various stages of the remaining
floors collapsing down on top of each other.&nbsp; In this structure every
floor above the main original ground level floor has collapsed into one large
mass.&nbsp; If there’s anything of interest in there for us, it will take an
archaeology crew to conduct a lengthy and meticulous excavation layer by layer
from the top, something well beyond the capabilities of a general exploration
mission such as ours.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn sighed.&nbsp; “Alright, thank you Felix.”&nbsp;
Kathryn looked down sympathetically at Molly, who had heard the exchange.&nbsp;
“I’m sorry,” she said softly.&nbsp; “Eventually such a team will be dispatched
here, but even if, well… whatever’s left in there will all have been
crushed.&nbsp; I’m sure what they find there will help get the Mormons jump
started in their research, but I doubt there will be anything in there that can
properly restore you, certainly not that we can access today or with this
mission.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
understand,” Molly somberly replied.&nbsp; “I appreciate your efforts Captain,
and I trust you will do whatever you can to help me.&nbsp; When appropriate I
will volunteer everything I can think to tell you regardless.&nbsp; You have
proven your intent to help me; I see no reason to hold anything back anymore.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Thank
you,” Kathryn offered sincerely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Captain
Barnes,” Irvina called out to her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
is it Irvina?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I see
something that I… think might take the drone up to the next level.&nbsp; It
looks like an emergency stairwell or something?&nbsp; Should I send it up to
check it out?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Sure,”
Kathryn said, leaving Molly and heading over to Irvina.&nbsp; “Can’t hurt, may
as well explore what we can of the interior while we’re here.&nbsp; Felix
please flag this building on the maps for later expeditions, as well as the
mall Molly claimed that other structure was, I’m sure that would be just as
interesting to archaeology teams.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Already
done.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Interesting…”
Irvina muttered as she watched the video feed from the drone.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It powered its way through a door frame which must have
originally been closed with a heavy fire door and found itself in a main lobby
area.&nbsp; There was broken glass and rocky debris and rubble everywhere, to
the point that one rarely saw the floor in the video feed.&nbsp; Like in the
first building they explored there were just empty cavernous spaces where one
business or another once occupied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Wait!!”
Molly cried out.&nbsp; “Stop the drone!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Irvina cancelled the drone’s automated search pattern and
commanded it to simply hover in place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Slowly
pan it back around to the right please,” Molly requested, uncharacteristically
polite.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Irvina did as she was asked and relayed the command to the
drone.&nbsp; They all watched as it slowly rotated and they all strained to see
what Molly had thought she’d seen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Okay
stop.&nbsp; Zoom in on the base of that rubble pile there.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Irvina did so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Do you
see that?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>See
what?” Kathryn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That…
large object sticking out of the rubble.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh.&nbsp;
Oh yeah, okay I see what you’re talking about, what do you think it is?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Doesn’t
it look to you like something you’ve seen on the ship?&nbsp; In the lab where
you removed my head?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
really don’t uh….”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh for
God’s sake Kathryn, it’s a simulant packing crate!!&nbsp; You had four embedded
in the wall of New Horizon’s sim bay for long term storage of your founder
sims.&nbsp; I knew it!!&nbsp; Simulants are such expensive products to
manufacture that their shipping containers are virtually indestructible in
order to protect the valuable cargo within.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>And
you think there may be… what, an intact simulant in there?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>There’s
a chance,” Molly implored them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Alright,”
Kathryn shrugged.&nbsp; “Irvina, does that thing have x-ray?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Sure
does,” she answered and began instructing the drone to move towards the case
and activate its x-ray scanners.&nbsp; What they saw, seemed impossible.&nbsp;
They couldn’t make out the outward appearance of the simulant, but the x-ray
clearly made out a skeletal structure rather like an overall human’s, but not quite
as intricate as a human’s would be and thus clearly something else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>YES!!”
Molly loudly exclaimed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
understand your excitement Molly, but there’s a lot we don’t know about what’s
in that case.&nbsp; It may be incomplete.&nbsp; It may house an intact brain whichat
may be unfair to purge just to put you in it,” Kathryn suggested, attempted to
reason with the head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>An
incomplete simulant wouldn’t be crated up like that Kathryn, only one ready to
ship.&nbsp; And, after so long without a power supply, there’s no way there is
anything left of the brain, it’ll surely have lost all of its data, so
bam!&nbsp; A blank but working brain for Mormon scientists to study as well!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Okay,
okay, but… it’s still going to be hellishly dangerous to try to drag that thing
out.&nbsp; I mean… besides getting crew all the way through to that thing, it
looks like trying to pull it out could bring down the whole rubble pile it’s
embedded in.&nbsp; If we<span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>…</span>
if we go for this now, it’s a big risk Molly.&nbsp; We should wait, bring out
an archaeology team to properly dig down from the top and get down to it
safely.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Kathryn?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>No.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I have
waited for this day for six hundred years.&nbsp; If you resist I’ll just send
my people in there and hope for the best, but it’ll be safer and have a far
better chance of success if you help me.&nbsp; If we can’t get it out we’ll
have to wait for the eventual excavation anyways, but I have to try in case we
can get our hands on it today.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn sighed heavily.&nbsp; “Okay Molly, okay…&nbsp; But,
I won’t subject any of my people to the danger, and if I think you’re
subjecting your own people to unacceptable risk I will cancel the op and call
them out.&nbsp; Agreed?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
agreed,” Molly answered quite eagerly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Molly walked over to Jaren and Francis to consult with the
engineers.&nbsp; “Thoughts?” she asked them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It’s
dangerous,” Francis offered with a shrug.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yeah,
I figured,” Kathryn answered impatiently.&nbsp; “The locals said that when they
tried to widen one of the drainage holes somewhere else there were
deaths.&nbsp; Do you think we could do it more safely?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>In
theory, yes,” Jaren offered.&nbsp; “We could reinforce the tunnels as we dig
them out.&nbsp; I’m afraid to say that it would be less dangerous for someone
to just crawl through the tunnel as it is.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn shuddered.&nbsp; She wasn’t claustrophobic, but she
was a living human being who had deep seated instincts to keep her that way,
and which warned her against crawling through tight unstable spaces which could
so easily entomb her alive.&nbsp; She turned to Kirby who seemed to be
listening in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
do you think?&nbsp; Could your people be brave or foolish enough to try to
crawl through that hole?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
but the hole is too small to pull that box out if we are successful.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Damn
good point,” she remarked to the engineers as she turned back to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Take
it out of the box,” they heard Molly’s voice call out to them from the scroll
in Kathryn’s pocket.&nbsp; Kathryn rolled her wrist to acknowledge to the
others that this was a solution which could work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Do you
think you can do this in relative safety?” Kathryn asked Kirby.&nbsp; “I
suspect you would follow your leader’s instructions even if you thought it was
a suicide mission, but I can’t allow that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We are
concerned about removing the box from the pile, but we believe we can safely
get to it and back.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn nodded and turned to the engineers.&nbsp;
“Suggestions?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>A fast
winch,” Francis offered.&nbsp; We could set it up in the stairwell and connect
it to that box, and we could try pulling it out gently but if it looks like the
place is going to come down we could just whip it back towards the stairwell
and hop it avoids the cave in.&nbsp; That way if the stairway remains intact it
will just be there at the top waiting for us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn nodded, and then opened a channel to the entire team
including Felix above.&nbsp; “Okay, here’s the plan.&nbsp; We’re going to equip
Kirby’s team with a fast winch and if they feel they safely can, they’re going
to crawl through the tunnel, up the stairs and to the package.&nbsp; They will
set up the winch, and then get back here outside before we start trying to
extricate.&nbsp; If successful they will go back in to open the package, remove
the simulant body and drag it through this tunnel here to us.&nbsp; We can use
the winch for that as well.&nbsp; Everyone clear?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She was answered by a chorus of nods and verbal acknowledgements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kirby consulted with his five compatriots and they decided
that the three smallest of them would go in, which did not include Kirby
himself.&nbsp; He would be staying out with the others.&nbsp; They equipped
each man going in with PANEs for their own benefit as well as to enable the
rest to monitor their progress and see what they saw.&nbsp; Irvina switched on
all of their small lights on their PANEs so they could see the inside of the
tunnel as well as what they’d see on the other side.&nbsp; The first man
climbed in and disappeared into the darkness of the hole, and Kathryn shuddered
with same instinctual dread which she had at the mere thought, but much
stronger now at actually seeing someone do it for real.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second man climbed in, then the third, and then not long
afterwards the first man exited the tunnel on the other side, followed by the
other two.&nbsp; “We’re inside,” one of them said over the comms.&nbsp; “We’re
making our way over to the stairway.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Aside from the video feeds from their PANEs, they were also
monitored from a distance inside by Irvina’s drone, and Kathryn was monitoring
all four video feeds simultaneously on her scroll.&nbsp; She watched as the men
carefully climbed the bare concrete walled staircase to the next level.&nbsp;
They then crossed the expanse of the main building lobby towards the simulant
box.&nbsp; When they reached it, Kathryn cringed as she saw one of them give it
a gentle tug to see how firmly it was embedded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It’s
pretty in there,” he reported, “but I think it can be pulled out with enough
strength.&nbsp; Very worried about cave in though.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>We
understand,” Kathryn assured him.&nbsp; “Please set up the winch as
instructed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a thick half ring embedded in the short side of
the casing material sticking out of the rubble.&nbsp; Kathryn wondered what
kind of material it was, since metal would have decayed in the intervening
time.&nbsp; She surmised that it must be some kind of advanced synthetic
polymer and figured the ring should hold up to the strain of the winch since it
seemed to be the natural hoisting point while being shipped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They connected the heavy steel cable to the half circle ring
and laid the cable down all the way back to the reception area down the
stairwell.&nbsp; They then set about wrapping the winch anchor wire all around
the railings in the stairwell, the thick concrete beam anchoring the stairwell,
anything sturdy in the area they could see, while leaving the winch mechanism
inline of the cable, resting about a meter away from the doorway to the
stairwell.&nbsp; Reporting that they were finished and ready to go, they
returned down the stairwell, through the Road Pod parkade, and out again
through the narrow drainage hole.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Good
work,” Kathryn acknowledged , patting them each on the shoulder as they each
came back through the hole.&nbsp; “I think we’re ready,” she told the others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren helmed the winch controls while Irvina piloted the
drone, holding it steady in the doorway to the stairwell, poking out just
enough to be able to see the simulant case in the dark distance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Like
we discussed, I’m going to try to ease it out gently, but if I see a cave in
starting, I’m going to hammer it full power.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn nodded her acknowledgement and put her hand on his
shoulder as she stood behind him, watching him control the winch as he watched
the video feed from the drone.&nbsp; Little bursts of power to the winch did
seem to nudge the case, but it would result in rains of dust and the occasional
chunk of concrete rolling down on either side of the case and tow cable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren shook his head.&nbsp; “You see where this is going,
don’t you?” he asked her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I do,”
she answered.&nbsp; “Just do what you can.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Just a
few more nudges…” Jaren muttered to himself, “to make sure it’ll come free… and
snap.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He depressed the control fully and the case shot out of its
position in the rubble pile and across the lobby all the way down to the
stairwell door where it made a terrible racket, crashing into and off of the
walls there.&nbsp; It made such a terrible noise that they all heard it from
where they were standing outside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Hunh,”
Jaren said.&nbsp; “How anti-climactic.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn could see what he meant on the drone video
feed.&nbsp; Some loose rubble had filled in the void where the case had been
and while there was a noticeable amount of settling and debris shaken loose, it
was not as climatic a cave in as they had feared.&nbsp; “Well, let’s just call
that a win,” Kathryn said with a smile as she clapped him on his
shoulder.&nbsp; “Okay men,” she said to the explorers who had laid the
winch.&nbsp; “Back at it.&nbsp; Don’t worry about retrieving the winch if it’s
inaccessible, and I’ll leave it to you to figure out if you want to take the
simulant body out where it is or carry the box towards the drainage hole before
doing so.&nbsp; Use your best judgement.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Understood,”
one of them said, and then crawled back into the hole.&nbsp; Kathryn was getting
used to the sight at this point, but it still made her shudder slightly.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The three men exited the other side and made their way to
and up the stairwell.&nbsp; She heard them briefly discuss how they wanted to
proceed, and they settled on carefully bringing the case down the stairs and
carrying it to the hole before removing the contents.&nbsp; As they did so
Kathryn looked down at Molly and noticed that she was nervously biting her
lip.&nbsp; She must be concerned about damage from whipping it across lobby the
way they had, but she had said that those cases were practically indestructible
and she had approved the plan.&nbsp; Hell, that was why it was still around for
them to find.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With only a few cringe inducing bumps and drops of the heavy
case, they successfully manoeuvered it down the stairs and across the parking
garage.&nbsp; “How do we open it?” they asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn laughed out loud.&nbsp; “Damn good question!&nbsp;
Any suggestions Molly?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Emergency
release on the opposite side from the lifting ring,” Molly answered
uncharacteristically seriously.&nbsp; “There’ll be a panel you can already
break, well… which means it will probably have been broken away, and a handle
underneath.&nbsp; Crank the handle several times until you break the seal and
can remove the lid.&nbsp; Make sure it’s right side up, you should be able to
feel the lip of the lid even though it’s sealed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The men realized that it was upside down and flipped the
case over.&nbsp; Sure enough the breakaway panel was long gone but the handle
was intact, and as instructed they yanked on the stiff lever repeatedly until
they heard a pop and were able to remove the lid.&nbsp; They removed the top
packing material and got to work removing the lifeless figure, laying it on the
bare soil ground before the hole.&nbsp; They tied a loop of rope around the
figure’s chest to allow them to drag it out through the hole, and then tied the
other end of the rope to one of the men’s feet.&nbsp; He then climbed into the
hole and the others lifted the body into it behind him so that he could pull it
along behind him.&nbsp; On the other end he was helped out by Kathryn and the
others, and they then carefully pulled out the body he pulled behind him,
gingerly resting it on an alter they’d built out of the water to keep it
dry.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was a simulant of an elderly woman, easily in her mid
sixties, thin and somewhat short, with long and full bone white hair.&nbsp; She
was naked of course, and as they laid her down and looked on her, she seemed
almost like an angel rescued from the depths of the Earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Patricia lifted Molly’s head and attached backpack up so she
could see it, and for what seemed like a long time Molly was speechless as she
looked the body up and down.&nbsp; It was hard for the others to accurately
gauge the expressions on her face.&nbsp; Not only were they somewhat cryptic,
not only did she only have half of a face left for them to read, but it also
seemed as though her expressions often changed and shifted through different
phases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After what seemed like a long time she was finally able to
utter: “She is… beautiful.&nbsp; I love her.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class=MsoNormal>Chapter 21</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn and Jaren burst through the door to the dining hall,
almost falling together to the ground as the door slid open after they’d been
leaning on the other side of it.&nbsp; At first Kathryn pulled on Jaren’s shirt
to keep him from falling but in the process nearly fell over herself, but this
time Jaren was secure enough to keep hold of her arm to prevent her from
falling to the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It turned out that unbeknownst to any of the others who did,
several of all three crews had brought alcoholic drinks to celebrate with
should the occasion arise.&nbsp; Tonight seemed like an appropriate night to
celebrate all they had accomplished on this mission, and they had a good laugh
as they all discovered that so many others had had the same idea when everyone
had thought it had just been them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It hadn’t been a formal party, more like some concurrent
parties in different living quarters nearby each other in the habitat ring,
with people floating between the different locations, enjoying the company at
each.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren and Kathryn had stolen away to find something to eat,
so they’d stumbled their way down to the dining hall, but they both had
something else unambiguously on their mind.&nbsp; Their mission was effectively
over, there was no longer any need of pretense of professionalism anymore as
Kathryn slowly walked backwards, urging Jaren towards her with a gesturing
finger, and the seductive eyes she’d once practiced in the mirror but never found
herself particularly effective in.&nbsp; She was drunk enough to be feeling
playful though in such an open sensual invitation she’d ordinarily never be
altogether comfortable with.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She was having fun tonight though; she was allowing herself
to be comfortable with behaviour she ordinarily wouldn’t.&nbsp; She was also
long past the point of being concerned that Jaren would reject her for anything
she might do in a moment of silliness.&nbsp; They<span lang=JA
style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>’</span>d both been hungry to be this way so
openly for some time now.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When he got close enough she turned to bound away
mischievously, but he caught her and pulled her towards him and embraced her in
a long and lingering hug from behind, and they slowly rocked back and forth
together as she stroked his arm appreciatively, savouring the closeness.&nbsp;
How long it had been since she’d felt this way, how much she felt like she’d
never felt quite this way before at all, how much she was looking forward to
turning around and kissing him again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was at that moment that all the lights went on in the
dining hall, which startled them as much as it blinded them.&nbsp; “Ahem,” they
heard Molly say from where she was sitting in the middle of the room above one
of the viewing portals to the outside of the ship.&nbsp; “I… didn’t want to
bother you, but I was worried the longer I didn’t say anything the weirder it
would get.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn smiled and walked towards her, pulling Jaren by the
hand behind her.&nbsp; “Why did you have the lights off?” she asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Makes
seeing out the windows easier,” she distantly explained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It had taken two days of careful work, but between the
instruction and schematic data in the archives, and Molly’s own explicit
instruction, Jaren and the other engineers had successfully been able to
transplant her simulant quantum brain from her old head into the head of the
new body they’d found for her.&nbsp; She still had to carry around the
antimatter power source until engineers on Kobol could fashion her a proper
replacement of the kind she was built to house inside her, but having a fully
functional body, she was able to carry the battery herself in a backpack which
was such a minor inconvenience in the larger scope of things, and the life
she’d been consigned to only a couple short weeks ago.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn came over and sat down beside her around the
circular window in the floor, and Jaren followed suit by sitting beside
Kathryn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>How’s
the new body working out for you?” Jaren asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Everything
seems to be working okay Jaren, thank you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>My
pleasure.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It’s
funny though… I always imagined that I wanted a young woman’s body again, I
always longed for the beauty of my youth.&nbsp; But now…”&nbsp; Molly looked
distantly at her own hand as Kathryn had noticed her doing quite frequently
since being transplanted.&nbsp; She seemed interested in the look of her new body
overall, but especially the hand she’d been missing all those years.&nbsp; “Now
I really don’t think I’d want it any other way.&nbsp; I fell in love with this
body at first sight.&nbsp; To want a young woman’s body would be…” she sighed,
“to be chasing a re-becoming of what I once was, a regression.&nbsp; But
simulant or not, I’m not a young woman anymore… and this new embodiment I think
much better represents the woman I have become.&nbsp; It conveys the wisdom of
age, compared to my original body it is ancient… as I am.&nbsp; I suspect it
will take some time until the sight of myself in the mirror doesn’t shock me,
until I can even recognize my own hands.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With the hand she’d been musing over she reached over for
the bottle she’d apparently been drinking out of.&nbsp; “You humans have it
easier I think. &nbsp;Sure you actually age, but it dawns on you so
gradually.&nbsp; Sure you periodically look in the mirror and are shocked to
realize how much you’ve aged but that’s just the product of accumulated
denial.&nbsp; You can see the passage of time in your face anew every day if
you really look for it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She poured each of them a glass of the liquid.&nbsp; “One of
the Kobol crew was kind enough to allow me to try some of this alien pink
champagne.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Ah
yes,” Jaren acknowledged in understanding, “beashou.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Can
alcohol even affect you Molly?” Kathryn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
well… the system detects and simulates the effects,” she said as she handed the
glasses of bubbling pink liquid to the other two.&nbsp; “Molly though…” she
considered reflectively.&nbsp; “Hardly an appropriate name anymore is it?&nbsp;
Rather a girl’s name don’t you think?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other two shrugged.&nbsp; It wasn’t a common name for
people of any age group on either of their worlds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
think Margaret might be more appropriate for a woman of my age now.&nbsp; Yes…
I definitely see a Margaret in the mirror now much more than I see a Molly.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn laughed a lighthearted laugh that was a mixture of
moderate intoxication and sleep deprivation.&nbsp; “To Margaret!” she exclaimed
as she held up her glass.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>To
Margaret!” Margaret and Jaren parroted and likewise raised their glasses before
all three drank the entire contents of their glasses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They were quiet for a short time in reflection.&nbsp;
Kathryn looked on Margaret and found that she really did seem to suit her new
body.&nbsp; She was wearing a fitted and conservatively cut dress with her
thick bone white hair pulled back in a ponytail.&nbsp; Her eyes were pale blue
and remarkably piercing, and the lines and wrinkles on her face suited her,
they suggested a life well lived more than a life of conflict survived.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Jaren,”
Kathryn said as she put a hand on his shoulder, “why don’t you go and wait for
me in Felix’s room with all of the others.&nbsp; I’ll meet you there, okay?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Sure,”
he answered.&nbsp; He understood well enough, and was happy to leave them some
time to discuss in private with Margaret whatever she wanted.&nbsp; He put a
hand behind her head and pulled her towards him to meet his leaning forward and
gave her a kiss on the forehead before standing himself up and making for the
door with only the slightest hint of an alcohol induced stagger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Can I
ask you something?” Kathryn asked Margaret.&nbsp; She nodded slowly with that
same mischievous smile Kathryn had come to know of her before she’d even
changed bodies.&nbsp; “You know?” she laughed.&nbsp; “I’ve forgotten what I was
going to ask!&nbsp; Guess I’ve had too many of these…” she said as she looked
at her glass and whirled it around with a grin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Hmm,”
Margaret said, looking down with a smile.&nbsp; “You know… I never realized
before how much I associated my body with what was done to it, with… what it
was made for,” she said as she poured another modest amount of rose coloured
sparkling liquid into Kathryn’s glass and then her own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>My
obsession with the youth and beauty I once had… I think at some point it became
metaphor for my… my innocence or something.&nbsp; Does that make any sense?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>It’s
almost like I wanted to go back not just to a state of a perfectly functioning
body, but a new body like this one, fresh out of production, completely…
untouched.&nbsp; Virgin perhaps.&nbsp; And now this body, not only is it
completely fresh and brand new, not only is it untouched, but it is the body of
someone who was loved, someone who lived a life, someone… who I believe lived a
happy life, though I have nothing to base that on of course, I just have a
feeling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Now,
in this body, I feel like I am free of so much, not just my infirmities, but
all of the baggage I was carrying around in that body, all of the bitterness
and bad experiences I associated with it.&nbsp; Of course I had a lot of good
times in that body as well, all those years with Colin and our children… those
were good years.&nbsp; But it’s weird, somehow I feel like those are mine to
keep still, part of my mind instead of my old body which I can shed all of that
darkness away with.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Does
it bother you at all that Jaren is going to take your old body back to Kobol
for study?&nbsp; It’s use in another sense.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Margaret thought about it for a moment.&nbsp; “No, I don’t
think so, not at all… I’m not in in it anymore, it’s not me anymore.&nbsp; I
guess that’s really the key isn’t it?&nbsp; Things that I feel were done to my
body I can leave behind with it, things in my mind I get to keep.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Sounds
good to me,” Kathryn said as she finished the last of her drink.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Margaret looked at her for several moments with those
piercing pale blue eyes.&nbsp; “You two are quite obviously very much in
love.&nbsp; Obviously you’ve forgiven him.&nbsp; I’m happy for you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Thank
you.&nbsp; It’s new, but… it’s also so different from anything I’ve ever
known.&nbsp; I can be silly with him, that’s so new for me.&nbsp; I feel like I
can… be myself in a way I’ve never been able to before.&nbsp; He feels like my
equal in every way.&nbsp; I don’t have to impress him, and he never fails to
impress me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>That’s
the best you could hope for I would think,” Margaret offered as she finished
her own glass.&nbsp; “A word of advice though.&nbsp; Cherish it. &nbsp;No
matter how well it goes it will all be over all too soon, so it goes…&nbsp;
Every moment you’re able to remember to, cherish that you’re still alive and
that you’re with him, that it’s a wonderful moment to live.&nbsp; Know that
someday it will all be over in every sense, and let that dark reality in just
enough to highlight in grand relief how wonderful it is that day has yet to
come.&nbsp; Look at me, six hundred plus years and a brand new body, and I
still feel sad at the idea of it all coming to an end someday.&nbsp; Sixty
years, six hundred years, six thousand years, it doesn’t matter.&nbsp; No
matter how much time you have it’s never enough.&nbsp; One more day will always
be the most valuable commodity in the universe for any mortal being, and you
and your team have given not only me, but this whole planet hope for the first
time in a long time, a new hope for one more day to live. </p>

<h4 class=MsoNormal>Chapter 22</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Three months later…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Aboard Orbital One, dignitaries and VIPs of all sorts and
varieties from all colony worlds had gathered for the signing of an historic
treaty known simply as ‘The Terran Accords.’&nbsp; They were gathered in the
hastily refurbished former United Nations meeting place on the station, a large
semi-circular amphitheatre style room.&nbsp; There was a large and elevated podium
at the front for individuals to give addresses to the convened crowds.&nbsp; As
Margaret stepped up to the podium, flanked by Patricia on her right, and Kirby
on her left, above her heads were the flags of the old United Nations,
alongside the flags of Haven, Kobol, and Roma.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It had been relatively easy work to restore Orbital One to
this point after Kathryn, Jaren, and Teresa had issued their final reports to
their homeworlds on the way back to the Solar rift system.&nbsp; A flurry of
official communication and daring proposals fluttered back and forth between
the three colony worlds and before New Horizon reached the rift, several
engineering teams and support ships had already been dispatched towards the
Kobol and Roma suns to get to work on Orbital One.&nbsp; Whatever would have to
be negotiated as far as what could and should be done with Earth itself, the
station itself at least seemed to be fair game and there was an informal
agreement that responsibility for it would be shared, an agreement which would
be formalized in the Terran Accords.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The political leaders of all three worlds met for the first
time at the station, after their many teams had established a Kobolian
artificial life support system, simply bypassing the original system of
arboretums throughout the station. &nbsp;The New Horizon team had already
managed to restore the basic operating system, but every system still had to be
initialized if possible, or replaced with equivalent or superior equipment if
not.&nbsp; The fusion reactors, the wider power and data networks, the docking
area and the commercial habitat ring… in a sense they had only gotten started
on the project, they had months and months if not years of work ahead of them
to fully restore Orbital One to its original glory, but they were well on their
way.&nbsp; They already had things to a level which allowed them to host this
historic meeting on the station in relative safety.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren had been emblematic to how his people in general
reacted to the reality of simulants and the embodiment of Margaret
herself.&nbsp; At first they had been viscerally aghast, taken back on a nearly
primal level at the offence unto God.&nbsp; However much like Jaren himself,
the more they got used to the idea, the more they were able to see past this
initial reaction and see the value in it.&nbsp; They came to recognize it as a
technology completely unlike anything they had developed themselves, and how
understanding the technology which created simulants could advance their
science and technology in any number of ways.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Kobolians had originally not seen the value in exploring
Earth because they felt that it had nothing to teach them technologically, and
investigating the mystery of how Earth fell was pointless since for them it was
not a mystery at all.&nbsp; Now this had turned around for them with the discovery
of Margaret.&nbsp; Simulant technology was now a primary interest for them,
something they never would have found if they had been left to themselves, not
seeing the true value in pure curiosity driven research itself, the things you
find which you’d never think to look for.&nbsp; Now they were in very serious
negotiations with Margaret for as much access to her for study as they could
get.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Margaret was happy to oblige but operated on a different
sense of time given her age.&nbsp; She would indulge them in exchange for the
option of possibly developing some enhancements she had in mind which the
original simulant manufacturers would have considered a violation of their
prime objective of perfectly replicating a human being.&nbsp; The Kobolians
wanted access to her immediately and at great lengths, but she wanted to stay
in the Earth system for a time, and might in some months or years agree to make
an extended visit to Kobol and let them have their way with her for a good long
while as she explored their world and culture.&nbsp; Eventually she had every
intention of doing the same with Haven and Roma as well.&nbsp; From her
perspective though, in contrast with the Kobolian’s clear impatience, she had
all the time in the world, especially with her shiny new body.&nbsp; She felt
young again, despite the true age of her intellect.&nbsp; Where before the New
Horizon arrived, every new day felt like one narrowly stolen from unforgiving
death, now she felt like she easily had another half century in her at
least.&nbsp; She had lived so long in a black empty night, and now here the sun
had risen for her, and she could see an unexpected dawn stretching forth in
front of her, streaked with bold and vibrant colour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Romans were happy for the Kobolians having discovered
such an interest in Earth by way of the simulants, but had never been lacking
any such interest themselves.&nbsp; They had also been unaware of their
existence, but were less intent on studying Margaret herself.&nbsp; Like other
areas of technology, they resisted simply being handed the technology without
having earned the discovery of it for themselves.&nbsp; They still feared that
failing to develop a technology for themselves would impede the required
respect for the powers of such technologies, and believed that being given a
technology instead of developing it for themselves robbed them of something, a
certain pride and dignity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Haven’s President Kim was the most enthusiastic organizer of
the summit, and a leader in pushing for the Terran Accords overall, to the
point that from time to time she irritated the leadership of Kobol and Roma
with the way she sometimes talked as though her own people were the truer
descendents of Earth than the others.&nbsp; She had been fascinated with the
old New Commonwealth which used to occupy so much of this chamber, and had been
reading everything about it she could find in the archives for months
now.&nbsp; It sometimes felt to the others that she was trying to bring them
back into the human family, this person who only made contact with the rest of
them yesterday for all intents and purposes, and assuming so much when from
their perspective her civilization was still somewhat infantile in its level of
development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nonetheless, all three worlds had come together, and
although in broad strokes there was agreement about how everything in the Solar
System should be managed, they were still in the process of hammering out all
the fine details before the eventual signing.&nbsp; Some differences in
philosophical disposition as to what rights the current inhabitants of Earth
had, and to what degree the ruins should be preserved in the face of a desire
to rebuild the planet to its former glory, persisted.&nbsp; To guide them,
Margaret had taken the stand to give a public address.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Patricia in her same cherished pink flower print on white
sundress, and Kirby in his well-tailored animal skin outfit, had hardly left
her side since she had found herself in a new body.&nbsp; They were dubious at
first, but before long they accepted her in her new form completely.&nbsp;
Before New Horizon left the Earth, they had been kind enough to drop her and
her people back at her village where she was able to spend time with her people
in a the kind of intimate way she had been unable to for a very long time,
having been stuck down in the bowels of the dam for so long.&nbsp; She was no
longer angry or bitter at her predicament, and having the chance to live among
them for several months did much to heal her spirit after being spirited into a
brand new body.&nbsp; She fell in love with her people anew, and found herself
very proud of how well they had survived and thrived, and came to newly respect
who they were today more than merely lament everything she had seen them lose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She stood up to the podium, but at first did not
speak.&nbsp; As the voices murmured down to a whisper and eventually to a
pressing silence, she surveyed the crowd slowly, still operating on a different
sense of time from the rest of them.&nbsp; Her aides also surveyed the crowd,
but had a look more of vigilance and sternness than Margaret’s look of pride
and appreciation of the moment.&nbsp; Finally, just as the crowd was beginning
to wonder if something was wrong, she finally spoke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Who
speaks for Earth?” she asked.&nbsp; She looked around as some murmurs could be
heard in response to her question as though she might have actually wanted an
answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I ask,
because Earth clearly needs someone to speak for it.&nbsp; I have listened for
a week now, to you scheming and planning for how you can exploit the Earth, how
you can reshape it in an image you would like to see it in.&nbsp; However, I am
also heartened to hear some voices calling for respect for what Earth has
become over what it might have been in the past.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I
cannot speak for Earth, but I can speak for its past and present, for I have
lived both.&nbsp; The Earth of old was a masterpiece of high technology and
engineering, a gleaming utopia of social justice and progressive ideals.&nbsp;
It was also only brought to that point in response to nuclear war and a global
mass extinction due to our deforestation, destruction of natural spaces, and
reckless climate change.&nbsp; It was a world of mixed merits, and as beautiful
as it once was, before the fall it was already showing the signs of a possible
decline back into the greed and recklessness which brought us to the brink
before our second renaissance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>The
world of today is primitive, it is true.&nbsp; But it is a world of natural
beauty and environmental reclamation.&nbsp; Mighty cities which stood
impervious to nature for centuries, are now impossible to see, reclaimed by
nature and the animals who were there before humans ever arrived.&nbsp; It is a
world of natural beauty which its current inhabitants now live with
harmoniously.”&nbsp; She looked at Patricia and Kirby.&nbsp; “By necessity and
lack of other options to be sure, but in harmony nonetheless.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is beauty in what Earth once was, but it had a darkly
destructive and exploitative side.&nbsp; Likewise there is also beauty in the
Earth of today which you mustn’t fail to appreciate, though it certainly has
its challenges as well.&nbsp; I cannot speak for Earth, but I can speak for its
past as well as its present.&nbsp; I can be a bridge, if you would allow me to
be.&nbsp; I can offer my insight into the past and the present, to help you
build a future here which serves both what Earth was, and what it is today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
do the research!&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Do your excavations of the old cities!&nbsp;
But also do have respect for the ecology which has since taken their
place.&nbsp; Do so in such a way that you disrupt the local people and wildlife
in as minimal a way as possible, and strive to restore the land to what it was
before you conducted your research afterwards.&nbsp; Yes rebuild!&nbsp; But
select only a few key sites across the world to develop extensively, and let
the rest of the planet be as it is in peace.&nbsp; You are a multi system
civilization now, each with your own worlds, you don’t require any more than
this of this world.&nbsp; Yes help the current inhabitants of Earth!&nbsp; But
respect the people they have become and the ways of life they have developed on
their own in your absence.&nbsp; Have a standing invitation to any inhabitants
of Earth to come to your cities, to learn your ways and live as you do, but
don’t expect them to, and respect those who decline, and who remain content to
continue to live in their own ways, and strive not to judge them, their
cultures, or their ways of life by your own standards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Lastly,
I’d like to speak of reunion.&nbsp; The history of Earth is sadly, largely, a
history of war.&nbsp; I can see already how you are all too quick to think
antagonistically, to measure the interests of Kobol, or Haven, or Roma, or
Earth against the interest of others.&nbsp; You are too quick to it, too ready
to see each other as different from yourselves.&nbsp; Do not fall into the same
trap which so many humans have for so many centuries.&nbsp; It was hard enough
for peoples of neighboring nations to exist in peace, and you are all of
different worlds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>But,
you are ultimately all of Earth.&nbsp; You are all children of Earth, and that
is why you are all here, in an exercise in peace, to draft and sign this
treaty.&nbsp; This is a moment of great importance, as profound to the history
of humanity as each of your mighty missions leaving Earth themselves were so
long ago.&nbsp; And that is what you all are now, children of Earth and
critical sub-plots to the larger and greater narrative of humanity, just as
Earth itself has been since you left.&nbsp; But now, those stories are
combining and converging into one epic combined narrative, finally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>You
are one species, divided for too long, and now, finally reunited at last!&nbsp;
May friendship, cooperation, and sensitivity to each other never leave your
hearts!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn switched off the transmission as the applause was
reaching its crescendo.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Good
speech,” Jaren offered as he slowly popped one of the breaded crustacean
delicacies from Kobol into his mouth, playfully letting it linger in zero
gravity flight towards his mouth before snatching it out of the air.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
it was very moving.&nbsp; I hope we can live up to everything she said.&nbsp;
It certainly never occurred to me that might wind up going to war!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren laughed.&nbsp; “No, me either… besides, we’d crush
you,” he said with a wink.&nbsp; “I like her suggestions for how we approach
the reconstruction of Earth though, sounds very responsible.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two were alone in a private yacht Jaren had rented for
their honeymoon.&nbsp; Since leaving Earth orbit and no longer keeping away
from each other, they had been utterly inseparable, sometimes stealing away to
their suite together for days at a time on the weeks long journey from Earth to
Kobol through the Escher Rift.&nbsp; They had married immediately upon arrival
at Kobol in what Jaren swore was a modest ceremony but which still seemed
embarrassingly extravagant to her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn sometimes doubted herself for recklessly moving
things along between them so quickly, but she kept thinking about Margaret’s
words to her, about not wasting any time, about trusting her instincts and just
going with what felt right.&nbsp; Besides, the more time she spent with Jaren,
the more it felt right to be with him.&nbsp; He only ever seemed to become more
and more compatible with her, and she’d never experienced that before.&nbsp;
She could tell that he not only loved her deeply as a woman, but also
profoundly respected her as a human being and professional.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The craft they were on was rented from a facility in orbit
around Kobol; it was fast, and had living spaces for up to six people if one
didn’t mind being cramped, or just two if they wanted it to feel spacious.&nbsp;
It had a rotating arm with bulbs on either end, at the ends of which were
things like sleeping quarters and the kitchen and bathroom, but the vessel also
had large sections in the central sections for stretching out in zero gravity,
as well as the forward control area which featured a half globe fishbowl
viewing window.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They were currently in this forward area enjoying the view
as they orbited Saturn and coasted just a couple dozen meters above the
majestic rings.&nbsp; They marvelled at how brightly the light they reflected
off the sun lit up their cabin, especially when combined by all the light
reflected off the gaseous atmosphere to their left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>There
it is,” Kathryn pointed out.&nbsp; “See that orange body out there?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh, oh
sure, I see it.&nbsp; That’s where we’re going?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yup,
according to the archives it’s a moon called Titan, and before the fall there
was an orbital research and commerce outpost attached to it by something called
a space elevator.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>And
you want to check it out.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Un
hunh.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jaren laughed.&nbsp; “Alright then my dear, when I said we
could go anywhere and do anything you wanted for our honeymoon I really did
mean it after all!&nbsp; It certainly does sound interesting.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>There
you go, that’s the spirit!” she encouraged him.&nbsp; “We’ll make an explorer
out of you yet.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He gave her a playfully dirty look.&nbsp; “Titan it is!” he
finally declared with arms dramatically outstretched.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A control panel started blinking and softly buzzing to
Kathryn’s right, and she reached over to access the panel and bring up whatever
it wished to inform her of.&nbsp; She experienced a brief moment of horrifying
existential dread, but in the blink of an eye it was gone, and replaced instead
with a growing warmth radiating from the depths of her being, so much so that
Jaren noticed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What
is it?” he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kathryn snickered a little, and then as casually as
possible, remarked: “I’m pregnant.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Really!?”
Jaren replied in surprise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yeah,”
she laughed.&nbsp; “The health monitoring system built into the waste system
was cued by elevated hormone levels and did further testing to diagnose me,”
she smiled mirthfully at the thought of being ‘diagnosed’ with pregnancy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Oh that’s
wonderful!” Jaren said as he floated over and embraced her in big bear hung
which led them to softly bump against the large forward glass fishbowl.&nbsp;
As they slowly floated back in the opposite direction he gave her a lingering
and emotional kiss.&nbsp; Afterwards Kathryn smiled anew.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>What?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I was
just thinking about what Margaret said, about reunion.&nbsp; As far as we know
this is the first interplanetary pregnancy.&nbsp; It is the physical
manifestation of our reunion as a species.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>So it
is,” Jaren smiled.&nbsp; “What a delightful distinction for it to carry… begs
the question though, where do we raise it?&nbsp; Kobol or Haven?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Neither,”
Kathryn answered.&nbsp; “Earth, of course.&nbsp; We were both already planning
to stay long term at the Terran Research Institute they’re building on the
surface, I see no reason to change our plans.&nbsp; I still want to dedicate
myself to researching and developing Earth.&nbsp; I, I hope you do to…” she
asked, with her first hint of nervousness about how this would now all play
out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Of
course,” Jaren softly reassured her.&nbsp; I still want to be a part of that
with you, and I can’t think of a better place to raise the first child born of
two child civilizations of Earth than Earth itself.&nbsp; The manifestation
returns to the source, it’s… poetic.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Yes,
poetic…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>I just
hope we can visit our homeworlds often, not only would we miss them, but I
wouldn’t want to deprive our little ones of those worlds either.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Ones?&nbsp;
Plural?” she balked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>One
could hope,” Jaren playfully suggested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Well,”
Kathryn laughed, “let’s see how the first one goes first alright?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>Of
course…” he smiled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=JA style='font-family:"游明朝",serif'>“</span>But
you’re right… we should visit the other worlds as often as we can.&nbsp; I want
to show it everything, all of the beauty and wonder which all of our worlds
have to offer.&nbsp; We will raise it on Earth, but we will show it the worlds
and it will feel at home on all of them; it will be the first true citizen of
the cosmos.”</p>
