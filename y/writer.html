        <h1 class="display-4">I write books!</h1>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p class="lead">As I was graduating from my bachelor's degree at the University of British Columbia - Okanagan,
            with a major in psychology, a minor in philosophy, and having taken pretty much every first year science
            course, I started working on a literary project which was part work of fiction, part existential treatise,
            part trying to explain everything I have come to understand about life, the universe, and everything.
            <br><br>
            These books are works I am incredibly proud of, but they are artefacts of another time in my life, as well
            as a passion I plan to return to later on in my life. They reveal much about me, at times perhaps too much,
            and my thoughts and views change over time. These books are not the current focus of my life, and not
            something I am actively pushing, but I write them, they do exist, and they are available for whoever may
            care to take an interest in them.
        </p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p class="lead">The New Horizons trilogy is about a utopian vision of the future, a therapeutic thinking through
            of how it could all work out despite everything actually trending so negatively (and that was pre-Trump).
            It's set in Vancouver 150 years in the future, and focuses on a generational starship which leaves on a 150
            year journey to a distant neighbouring star.</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p class="lead">Launch, the first book, is about a man who grew up with maximum privilege and able to do
            anything with his life, but feels a profound ambivalence which comes from a lack of a driving force in his
            life. Applying to the New Horizons program effectively on a whim, he wins a spot and has to come to
            understand why he finds himself wanting to go, and walk away from his terrestrial obligations to surrender
            all his privilige, and die in deep space for a dream he'll never personally see realized.</p>

        <p class="lead">Midway, the second book, flips the situation and focuses on individuals halfway through the
            journey, the crew who grew up on the small ship, and who will inevitably die on the same small ship, and
            suffer this existence for the sake of other people's dreams, with no possibility of pursuing their own
            dreams. From maximum privilige, to none at all.
            <br><br>
            Despite careful social engineering, humanity bleeds through, and the gruesome first murder ever on
            the ship launches an investigation which unravels a plot by an original crewmember to undermine the core
            mission and find some way, any way, to construct a shred of authentic personally driven meaning in their
            lives, no matter what the costs.</p>

            themselves instead mediating bitter conflicts amongst the crew. One faction takes drastic action and the
            results leave not only the mission's ultimate success in peril, but the lives of everyone who travelled so

        <h1>The Uğur Manoeuvre</h1>
        <h3>by W. Ross White</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">
            Joyce and I had just gotten into Istanbul that evening, the last stop of
            our guided tour through the Balkans. We spent half of the day just making
            our way through the Istanbul itself through a gridlocked Istanbul Highway
            complete with young men selling roses, bottled water, and headphones as
            they walked between the highway lanes. Being more adventurous than others
            in our tour group who might seek out the safety of the hotel restaurant, we
            went out into the dusk of a fall Istanbul evening to seek out our dinner.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            We didn’t stray far from out hotel, but we did walk up and down nearby
            streets seeing what we could see since we would be staying in the area for
            three nights. It’s strange being in a foreign place, and Turkey was
            certainly the most foreign place I’d ever been. In shops and restaurants,
            people inside speak a smattering of English if any at all, and
            communication is frequently a multi-modal struggle, trying to find key
            words we both understand mixed with pointing and other gestures.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            We settled on a place called Uğur Usta, and for only one reason; I’d
            recently started watching a man named Cenk Uygur on an internet news show.
            So we went in. We’d actually walked past it earlier and been put off at
            first by a man sitting on a motorcycle and smoking right outside the door,
            but we later figured out he was a delivery guy.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            We happened to show up soon after four other people from our tour group,
            and when the man who was serving us understood that we knew each other, he
            began pushing tables together so we could all sit together. Joyce and I had
            been looking forward to a quiet dinner alone after spending so much time
            with our tour group, so with the heat inside the restaurant as our excuse,
            we extricated ourselves from the others as politely as we could and instead
            sat down at the table just outside. It was delightfully cool, and it gave
            us the opportunity to watch the world go by. We were on a narrow street,
            but only a few storefronts down there was a much more interesting larger
            street.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            The man serving gave every appearance of being the owner, and I assumed he
            was the Uğur the restaurant was named after. He was a late middle aged man
            with typically swarthy Turkish skin and was bald on the top of his head. He
            seemed to be very friendly, but it was difficult to communicate with him.
            We all made assumptions, claiming to understand what each other were saying
            when we really didn’t. He seemed concerned that we were sitting outside, he
            kept looking up and holding his hand out as though he were concerned we
            would get dripped or rained on. The menu had an English section… sort of,
            and when he first came to serve us we just ordered a couple drinks.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            After receiving our drinks, we had to negotiate the menu which was
            challenging, but not impossible since in addition to rough English
            translations it had pictures of the items. Wanting to sample various things
            when so far from home, we each picked two things we wanted to try. When
            Uğur came back we pointed out the items we wanted as we gave mangled
            pronunciation attempts. Uğur moved his hands around in a circle in a
            questioning way and asked “together?” in addition to some other words we
            couldn’t make out. Joyce and I looked at each other and simply agreeably at
            him together. We figured he was asking if we wanted everything at the same
            time as opposed to one after another.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            After a short time, Uğur brought us some food which we definitely hadn’t
            ordered. It was something rather like a pita football; it was a large thin
            pita filled with hot air, complete with two kinds of what as a westerner I
            can only describe as salsa, one was some kind of red sauce with fine
            chunks, and the other was some kind of Turkish Greek salad. Joyce and I
            looked at each other somewhat confused. We didn’t know if this was
            something we were to eat with our meal when it came out, or if it was while
            you wait snack. Cautious at first, I ripped off a piece of pita, dipped it
            in the red sauce, and tried it. It was good!
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Uğur then returned and mystified us. He brought out four small glasses, and
            after clearing a large central area on our table, he placed them upside
            down in a square, and put small wet napkins on top of each of them. We
            didn’t know what to make of that, but we were going to go along with it
            whatever came of it. We kept eating the pita and dip, and before we knew it
            we had eaten all of the pita. When he came back and asked if we could have
            another pair of drinks and another pita, he seemed to laugh at us, but
            before long he’d brought our drinks and another inflated pita which we
            tried to eat more slowly.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Then came our next surprise, but at least it answered our previous
            confusion. The glasses were a stand for the large platter he brought us and
            set upon them. We realized then that when he’d asked: “together?” he was
            asking if we wanted it all on one big platter to share. Happy for the
            revelation, we then investigated what we’d gotten. Some of the things we
            recognized as things we had ordered, others things not so much. In
            retrospect, I imagine some of the items were sides for the dishes we’d
            ordered.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            On the platter was kafte, seasoned ground lamb meat on a skewer, more
            recognizable kebabs, an eggplant dish Joyce had ordered, and for some
            reason most memorable for me, some sort of onion salad which is hard to
            describe. It had sliced white onions in a light orangey-red sauce heaped in
            a pile on the platter. Whatever it was it was delicious. So, not sure how
            we had gotten everything we’d ordered, we nevertheless happily ate it, and
            I believe we wound up eating all of it, including a second pita. Not long
            after having brought our food out, Uğur then for some reason brought us
            fresh cutlery, and then proceeded to take one of the eggplants off of the
            platter with Joyce’s utensils, place it on her side plate, and ‘show’ her
            how to cut it and eat it. To this day we still can’t quite figure that one
            out.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Once we’d finished our meal, something happened that neither Joyce nor
            myself will ever be able to forget. After clearing our table and while we
            were still talking about our meal, he came back with a dust buster style
            hand vacuum and started vacuuming up off our table very thoroughly. It was
            the damndest thing, and Joyce and I just lifted our eyebrows and looked at
            each other in bewilderment. Was this a common thing for them to do here?
            Was it just a Uğur thing? Did he think we ourselves had just been
            particularly messy? He did it like it was the most natural thing in the
            world, grinning at us back and forth as though if not this, then what could
            a dust buster have possibly have been invented for?
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            After giving us a thorough dust busting, we believe he asked us if we
            wanted any dessert. We were pretty full so instead I did the best I could
            to ask him for the bill, and he seemed a little disappointed. After paying
            and leaving him what I thought was a reasonably generous tip, I watched as
            he went inside and had an exchange with a younger man working behind the
            counter inside. I believed I saw the younger man ask Uğur how the tip was,
            and he seemed to give a shoulder shrug and raise a hand palm up as if to
            say ‘enh, adequate I guess.’ I imagined him asking himself, ‘I vacuumed
            their table, what else could I have done?’
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            We soon left and spent much of the rest of the night revelling in our
            befuddlement. Over the rest of our stay in Istanbul we ate in several
            restaurants, and not one other time did we ever see anyone else break out
            the dust buster. I guess it was just a Uğur specific eccentricity… Our last
            night in Istanbul we went back there to have dinner again, but it was
            Sunday and the restaurant was all shuttered up. So we instead wound up
            having dinner at the restaurant in our hotel and although it was an
            excellent meal with a story all its own, there was no dust buster. Cenk
            Uygur has something he calls his Uygur Manoeuvre, but I’ll always remember
            the Uğur Manoeuvre to be pulling out a dust buster on unsuspecting
            Canadians.

        <h1>The Greyhound Incident</h1>
        <h3>by W. Ross White</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">
            I almost died that day… Well, not really. Actually, overall it went about
            as well as anyone could have hoped for, if it had to happen at all.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            The Coquihalla highway was closed due to severe avalanche risk so Greyhound
            had been taking the longer but very scenic Hope-Princeton Highway to
            Kelowna. The extra time it took created a passenger backlog though, and by
            the time of my scheduled trip, they’d had to charter a second bus.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            I made the mistake of choosing to ride on the charter bus because it was
            supposed to arrive earlier than the regular bus since it wasn’t making most
            of the stops along the way. Since I’d loaded up with snacks and drinks
            ahead of time, fewer stops wouldn’t be a problem for me.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Once in the snowy mountains, we were coming around a bend, and a semi-truck
            travelling in the opposite direction came over the centre line, and forced
            our driver to veer to the right to avoid a collision, and we wound up in
            the ditch. As we ran over the rumble strips at the side of the road and
            started going over, I thought: ‘oh, okay… well THIS is happening.’
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            We landed on a 45 degree angle, with me on the high side and sitting on the
            arm rest. A number of bags had flown out of overhead compartments and one
            wanged a woman on the head pretty good. ‘Ok,’ I thought, ‘well THAT just
            happened.’ I resigned myself to the reality that my day was ruined.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            We were on the outside of a bend in the road on a wide curve to the right,
            and we’d gone into the ditch at the base of a tall hill. The scariest parts
            were the cars and trucks coming up over the hill ahead of us, and finding
            it very difficult to stop. We watched several near misses until a different
            semi-truck stopped beside us and offered to help. Before cluing in to using
            road salt and tire chains, he very nearly slid into us as he tried to get
            moving again. Even with chains his tires idly spun around and around as he
            inched over the next hill. People who stopped to help were sent on their
            way to call in the accident when they could since we had no cellular
            signal.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Our driver tried backing up onto the road again which worried me, since all
            that was behind us was oncoming traffic blindly coming around the bend. He
            only succeeded in backing up in the ditch and created a bus shaped trench
            ahead of us.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            We’d effectively rolled over onto our exit door. We could have broken a
            window, but then we’d be exposed to the cold. Instead we stayed inside
            risking carbon monoxide poisoning as the bus kept us warm by idling and
            exhausting into the solid snow bank behind us. Aside from the smokers it
            was remarkable how calm we all were. Yes we went off the road, but we’d
            landed on a large snow pillow and nobody had been seriously hurt. If it had
            to happen at all, it really couldn’t have gone any better.
        </p>
        <p>
            Around this time a Shriner hospital bus happened by, and the driver offered
            us a lift since he was empty and already headed that way. It was such a
            kind offer; I have no idea how we would have carried on once we were
            rescued if that bus hadn’t stopped and offered to help us.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            When the first paramedic arrived, the brown haired woman squeezed her way
            through the pinned front door while joking about how she shouldn’t have had
            that ice cream earlier. She assessed the woman who’d been hit on the head
            and a couple others who had concerns. Not long after the ambulance showed
            up, so did everyone else. One of the good natured rescue guys came onboard
            to figure out how they were going to get us out, and when someone
            complimented him on his solo mustache, which he proudly proclaimed “oh
            yeah, 70s porn ‘stache.”
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            It had now been two hours since the crash, and it was dark outside. They
            decided they were going to break the already cracked right front window and
            file us out through it. They easily smashed the window out, removed the
            rubber stripping, and placed a matt over the bottom for us to safely climb
            over onto a step ladder on the outside.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Since I was sitting near the front, I was one of the first out after those
            with medical concerns. After hopping through and having my bag handed to
            me, I thanked the crews profusely, and then climbed out of the bus-shaped
            trench onto the highway. I could see a long snaking line of lights from the
            vehicles stopped behind us. The scene was absorbing, the flashing lights,
            the fresh snow piled a meter high, and a series of people being helped out
            of a bus through a smashed front window were mesmerizing. After a little
            playful sliding on the icy roadway, I helped some of the others transfer
            our baggage from the crashed bus onto the Shriner one.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            My second big mistake of the day, was allowing most of the other passengers
            onto the new bus before me, despite being one of the first off of the last
            bus. I figured there would be as much room on the new bus as there was on
            the old, but I was wrong. After climbing aboard, I made my way past some
            very comfortable looking, but very occupied recliner chairs. Further up the
            aisle were hospital beds with three people sitting on each and as I passed
            them it dawned on me that there was absolutely nowhere for me to sit. I was
            one of the last people on the bus, and there was hardly even any floor left
            for me to sit on.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            The best I could do was to find a square half meter of floor for myself
            between the coffee machine above my head, the bathroom ahead of me and its
            door frequently opening into my leg space, and a cabinet latch digging into
            my back. Not long after I’d resigned myself to this bitter situation, an
            endless parade of inconsiderates stepped in my space to help themselves to
            the expensive single cup coffee maker and bottled water over my head. The
            kindness of the bus driver giving us a ride, was being repaid with theft.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Twenty minutes after finally getting underway again, we were stopped for
            another two hours due to yet another accident further up the road. Only now
            did I lose my sense of humour with the situation. So far it was an easily
            bearable interesting adventure, but after we were stopped again for an
            unknown length of time, I was now fully embittered.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            When we finally started moving again, after twenty minutes travel, we were
            stopped again for yet another hour. After this, our three hour trip the
            rest of the way to Kelowna continued on uninterrupted.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            At some point, we started getting phone service again, and as I coaxed my
            phone into sending a simple ‘I’m ok’ to Joyce, all at once I received
            increasingly concerned messages from her, ending with a desperate sounding:
            ‘I don’t know what to do…’ It was bittersweet to have someone worry about
            me like that. It was comforting, but at the same time knowing she was
            worrying about me was the worst part of the ordeal since I couldn’t
            reassure her until the phones started working again.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            My next fun adventure was dodging the feet of all the people trying to use
            their phones plugged into a power bar behind the coffee maker over my head,
            which didn’t stop other people from nearly scalding me as they still tried
            to use the coffee machine over my head which was now down to only having
            hot chocolate inserts.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Finally I saw Okanagan Lake, and I knew I was almost home. People cheered
            as we finally pulled into the bus depot eleven hours after leaving
            Vancouver. Some clueless management guy stood at the front of the bus,
            blocking our exit only to offer apologetic platitudes. After everyone who’d
            had comfortable seating got off the bus I was finally able to exit, and I
            rushed through the terminal into a big hug with Joyce.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            In retrospect, what really stands out for me is how well it all went.
            Nobody flipped out or was hurt, and another bus was able to give us a lift.
            Aside from irritation and discomfort on the second bus, the worst part was
            just the hours of my life the incident consumed. I wasn’t left with a fear
            of bus travel; I was just the victim of a statistic; there was nothing I
            should have done to avoid it, and it’s nothing I should ever expect to
            happen again. Like so much of life, it was just some stuff that happened.

        <h1>Reunion: First Chapter</h1>
        <h3>by W. Ross White</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>Chapter 1</h4>

        <p class="lead">The year was 516.</p>

        <p class="lead">Well, actually there was some debate about that. Some
            people still chose to use the original Earth calendar would make the year 2839,
            but they were rather in the minority, and they became irritated if the similar
            arbitrariness of that calendar’s original day zero was pointed out to
            them. Kathryn Barnes herself felt that of all the possible arbitrary
            starting dates for their calendar, the day which their ancestors first arrived
            on the planet Haven seemed most appropriate if one had to be picked. It
            was after all a rather hard and undeniable boundary plane in their history.</p>

        <p class="lead">As big as that day must have been for them so long ago
            though, today was the biggest day in history which Kathryn herself would ever
            be lucky enough to witness (or so she thought), and she was sufficiently
            blessed to have a critical and central role in it. She was to be the
            first person ever to be launched into space after her civilization had lost the
            ability to do so less than a century after their arrival on the planet Haven.</p>

        <p class="lead">The generational ship which her ancestors had arrived in was
            still in orbit, but it had been abandoned there since they had lost the ability
            to return to it. It was kept operational in a support role to those on
            the surface for as long as was possible, but it came time to abandon it the
            very last of its fuel was used to boost it up to a high enough orbit that it
            would be preserved there for eons. It served as an ever present reminder
            to the people of Haven that they had come to this planet from another, and that
            it was their inalienable destiny to return to the stars once again.</p>

        <p class="lead">It was her destiny to return there today; she was the
            first. Test missions had demonstrated the capacity of their new rocketry
            to get her there, and another person had already conducted low orbit tests, but
            it was her and her alone who would be remembered by her people forever as the
            first person to step foot on the New Horizon again after it had been abandoned
            so long ago.</p>

        <p class="lead">Docking with it had been tricky. Although it was in a
            stable orbit, over the centuries it had worked up a multi axis spin which she
            had to account for. It had been a tense moment, but she had successfully
            latched her capsule to the moving docking hatch. Once secured, her vessel
            lazily spun along with the much larger craft it was connected to.</p>

        <p class="lead">She held her breath, and then pushed herself across the
            threshold. Her capsule was trying to transfer sufficient power to allow
            the space ship to reinitialize basic things like emergency lighting, but it
            hadn’t worked yet. So far, the powerful lights on either side of her
            helmet and ambient light from the interior of her own spacecraft were all that
            provided any illumination. If the ship were operational, there would be
            simulated gravity up on the rotating habitat ring, but down in the engineering
            section where the docking ports were located, no such simulated gravity had
            ever been designed.</p>

        <p class="lead">Holding onto a railing, she breathed again. She
            absorbed the gravity of her situation, of holding a piece of the legendary ship
            in her hands, and of having such a tactile connection with her ancestors.</p>

        <p class="lead">"Commander
            Barnes?"</p>

        <p class="lead">"I’m
            good, everything is good up here, I’m just… overwhelmed."</p>

        <p class="lead">"That’s
            understandable, but we’re reporting to you that we’ve just had an unscheduled
            black out and we’re considering cutting your mission short."</p>

        <p class="lead">"A
            black out…" Kathryn echoed back in curiosity. She certainly hadn’t seen
            that coming. Like clockwork, blackouts had occurred every one year, six
            days, eight hours, three minutes and forty-two seconds for almost a hundred
            years now. One occurring out of that schedule was… well, as mysterious
            as them happening at all. It was an unexplained phenomenon which had
            begun hundreds of years after they arrived on Haven and which no accepted
            scientific theory could explain. Every one years, six days, eight hours,
            three minutes and forty-two seconds, their sun darkened for exactly seven point
            three eight seconds. It didn’t happen completely, but it was enough that
            it made one able to continuously look at their sun with the naked eye during
            that time without permanent damage.</p>

        <p class="lead">The last blackout was only a little under a month ago
            though, and why one should occur outside of such a regular schedule was as
            mysterious as the regular schedule itself or the phenomenon overall.</p>

        <p class="lead">"You
            really think that’s necessary?" Kathryn asked.</p>

        <p class="lead">"There
            are too many unknowns Barnes; we are dealing with an unknown disruption in the
            schedule of an unknown spatial phenomenon."</p>

        <p class="lead">"I’m
            here. I prefer to stay. I’ll return if you order me to of course or
            if something else comes of the phenomenon, but I don’t see any connection. We
            know there’s no radiological risks of a blackout; in fact it only reduces the
            solar radiation while its
            occurring. I think my carrying on is an acceptable risk."</p>

        <p class="lead">She waited anxiously while the team back at mission control
            reviewed their options. She’d been training for this and excited about it
            for a long time. It would be such a profound disappointment to have to
            turn back now.</p>

        <p class="lead">"Barnes
            we’re going to let you proceed but only provisionally. If anything else
            happens, even if its meaning is ambiguous we’re going to recall you, but
            barring that we’re going to allow you to proceed."</p>

        <p class="lead">"Thank
            you," she said with a smile, and continued to pull herself down the engineering
            central access corridor. It was her first time in authentic micro
            gravity, and she was enjoying the sensation of floating as she gently pushed
            herself off of one railing after another. She reached the central hub
            where the long cylinder of the engineering section met the spokes which
            suspended the habitat ring about it, and which was designed to rotate around to
            simulate gravity in the living areas of the ship.</p>

        <p class="lead">She shone her helmet light down each of the four spokes one
            at a time, but all four looked identical. </p>

        <p class="lead">"I’m at
            the central hub…" she reported as she observed the markings which labeled which
            tube was which. “Proceeding down tube three towards the bridge as
            planned."</p>

        <p class="lead">"Understood."</p>

        <p class="lead">As she started to push herself down the access tube, her
            radio broke in again. “Barnes get out now." </p>

        <p class="lead">"Understood."
            It was a direct and unambiguous order; she had to act on it without question.</p>

        <p class="lead">On her way back to her capsule, her team filled her
            in. “We had another unscheduled black out, twelve minutes after the
            previous one. We still don’t know what it means, but there’s definitely
            something going on and we just can’t have you up there and exposed."</p>

        <p class="lead">"I
            understand." She was disappointed, but she did understand. They
            would have been perfectly within their rights to have recalled her after the
            first unexpected blackout. She was lucky to have gotten as far as she
            did. She was lucky to be there at all. Whatever came next, she was
            first onboard again, and her people’s history would remember her as long as
            they remembered anybody. Still, she’d really hoped to have seen so much
            more. Maybe they’d let her come back.</p>

        <p class="lead">Before she floated back into her capsule, she noticed that
            the display panel just beyond the airlock was activated, and displayed on it
            was an incoming communication request. She didn’t know what to make of
            it. Her own people certainly wouldn’t contact her this way, and the power
            transfer to the ship from her capsule was never intended to power up the ship’s
            onboard comm system. Who else could it be?</p>

        <p class="lead">And yet, there it was, an unexpected and impossible incoming
            comm request, just as mysterious as the blackouts and the interruption of their
            otherwise clockwork schedule. Could there be a connection? </p>

        <p class="lead">"Tynes,
            I’m outside of the airlock to my capsule, and I’m… I’m seeing an incomming comm
            request on the airlock panel. It’s weird… that system shouldn’t have any
            power, there’s nobody who should be making such a call, and yet… there it
            is. I want to answer it and see what happens." </p>

        <p class="lead">"Please
            hold," her liaison at Tynes Spaceflight Centre requested while the occurrence
            she’d reported was discussed. It certainly wouldn’t be difficult to
            accept the call, although the New Horizons systems were optimized for thought
            control via devices which used to be known as Brainchips installed in every
            adolescent. Her own people were still many years away from recreating
            that level of neurocybernetics.</p>

        <p class="lead">"Barnes
            we’re going to allow you to proceed. We are all watching your helmet’s
            video feed very carefully down here."</p>

        <p class="lead">Nodding, she reached out to touch the answer button on the
            panel where it indicated, but just before her finger reached the panel, the
            comm request ended. With a furrowed brow she lowered her thickly gloved
            hand to her side with some confusion. She then nearly leapt out of her
            space suit when the comm request lit up again. After composing herself,
            taking a moment to laugh at herself a little as she did so, she reached out to
            touch the screen again.</p>

        <p class="lead">A strikingly attractive male face appeared on the screen.
            His strong jaw was clean shaven and he appeared to be a man in his late
            forties. His brown hair was neither particularly long or short, but was
            neatly cut, and he was wearing a crisp button up white shirt. </p>

        <p class="lead">"Greetings,"
            the man offered.</p>

        <p class="lead">"Greetings,"
            she tentatively offered in return without any idea what else to say. She
            was speechless not only at the look of him, but his mysterious presence on the
            comm panel at all.</p>

        <p class="lead">"My
            name is Jaren. I’ve come from the Eta Cassiopeiae system. “</p>

        <p class="lead">"Eta
            Cassioeiae," she muttered in repetition as she looked down through her face
            plate fishbowl for the significance of those words. The fact that there
            were other humans out there was not any kind of shock or unknown to
            Kathryn. It was well understood that her people had come from the planet
            humans had originally evolved on, and they’d always known there had been other
            colony missions before and probably even after their own. The thing was,
            since before her people had even landed on Haven, they’d lost contact with Earth
            and had never been able to establish contact with any other colonies around
            other stars.</p>

        <p class="lead">"Where
            are you?" Kathryn finally asked. She’d managed to compose herself and
            refocus on the job. “Where are you transmitting from? How did you
            power and access the New Horizon?"</p>

        <p class="lead">"I er,
            we are in your star system," Jaren answered. “My small crew and I are on
            our way to your planet to say hello. We’ve visited your system before,
            but we’ve never made contact before. We didn’t want to disturb your…
            development, but you’ve reached the point at which we decided to wait until
            before formally making contact."</p>

        <p class="lead">"And
            what point was that?"</p>

        <p class="lead">"When
            you were able to reach the New Horizon again. We left monitoring
            equipment here which let us know when you’d managed to accomplish this."</p>

        <p class="lead">"Ask
            him how he learned of this if he had to wait for a signal to be sent back to
            his own star system." Tynes Control demanded in hers ear.</p>

        <p class="lead">"How
            were you able to find out so fast?" She was instinctively suspicious of
            him. Maybe it was her training. Maybe it was her instincts as a
            woman to second guess someone she was attracted to. For whatever reason
            her eyes were perpetually somewhat narrowed in her scrutiny of him.
            “Wait, for that matter how did you get here so fast after finding out?"</p>

        <p class="lead">"We
            have a technology which allows us to open up portals between stars. We
            call it the Escher Rift. By harnessing the power output of an entire star
            for several seconds, and then redirecting it to a particular point in space,
            we’re able to open an Escher which allows us to instantaneously communicate or
            send a ship through." </p>

        <p class="lead">"The
            blackouts…" she suddenly understood, and could hear some commotion back on Haven
            as other people down at Tynes had the same realization.</p>

        <p class="lead">"The
            whatnow?" </p>

        <p class="lead">"We… we
            call them blackouts; our sun dims for seven point three eight seconds every one
            year, six days, eight hours, three minutes and forty-two seconds. That’s
            been your doing all along?"</p>

        <p class="lead">"Mmm,
            afraid so, yes. We’re very sorry if that disturbed or concerned you, but
            the specific time is just the precise length of a year on our planet. We
            programmed our monitoring devices to rift home a yearly update on your status."</p>

        <p class="lead">"And
            the two unexpected ones today were your drone reporting new activity and then
            you coming through in a ship."</p>

        <p class="lead">"Correct."</p>

        <p class="lead">"Well,
            that certainly that explains a lot." </p>

        <p class="lead">Jaren just smiled broadly and Kathryn had to look away or
            start smiling like an idiot herself in response. “I need to consult with
            my people," she told him as she pretended to be looking down at a
            communications device which didn’t exist. “Please send another comm
            request like you did before in two minutes alright?"</p>

        <p class="lead">"Absolutely."
            The panel screen returned to its inactive standby status.</p>

        <p class="lead">"Well
            Tynes, what do you think?" she asked.</p>

        <p class="lead">"It
            certainly explains the blackouts," a different voice affirmed in her
            helmet. It was the voice of the Flight Director Krantz himself.
            “Finally," he added with a deliberate note of irritation.</p>

        <p class="lead">"Barnes
            we need to know what they’re here for, what they want," he instructed
            her. “We also need to know if they know anything about what happened to
            Earth, and how many other colonies are out there. There’s so much to
            ask… We need to find out how their Escher technology works and how we can
            develop it for ourselves. If they can do that there has to be other
            technologies they’ve developed that we could get our hands on, not to mention
            their military capabilities and intentions."</p>

        <p class="lead">"Okay,
            okay, I get it." She was frustrated with his seemingly aimless
            musing. As the panel lit up again with another comm request she said to
            Krantz: “let’s just start with asking what they want from us…" She touched the
            panel again to system open the channel.</p>

        <p class="lead">"Why
            are you here?" she asked with deliberate assertiveness. She was trying to
            balance diplomacy with the subtlest of undertones of confident
            aggression. It was the same tone she put on when she had to be harsh with
            male underlings she thought didn’t adequately respect a female superior.
            “What exactly do you want from us? Why exactly did it matter to you when
            we reached this ship again?"</p>

        <p class="lead">He seemed a little taken aback at her assertiveness and she
            was pleased, she’d wanted to put him back on his heels just a bit.
            Attractive as he was, she’d grown increasingly uncomfortable with the power
            imbalance of him having all the answers and her only questions.</p>

        <p class="lead">Jaren leaned back in his chair, put his elbows up on his
            armrests and laced his fingers. He let out a sigh. “We want many
            things er, I’m sorry what did you say your name was?"</p>

        <p class="lead">"I
            didn’t," she informed him with a quickly darted up right eyebrow and flash of a
            smug smile. Power balance restored, she happily thought to herself.
            “But it’s Barnes. Commander Barnes of the Haven United Forces."</p>

        <p class="lead">"Commander,"
            he acknowledged her with a nod. “We seek friendship, open contact, and
            collaboration with your world."</p>

        <p class="lead">"Un
            hunh," she grunted dismissively. “And that’s all?" She asked. </p>

        <p class="lead">"No,"
            he admitted with pursed lips. “We also want access to the New Horizon’s
            archives."</p>

        <p class="lead">"Thank
            you for being honest. Tell me why."</p>

        <p class="lead">"My
            people… well, we quite regrettably and short sightedly declined to take most of
            Earth’s history or cultural heritage with us on our generational starship when
            we originally set out. We… they, didn’t think it was important, but…
            well, they were wrong." She found herself a little touched at how
            sincerely sad he seemed to be at this profound error of his forebears.
            “We have made contact with one other colony since we’ve developed the rift
            technology, but unfortunately they made a similar error when they left.
            We tried looking for answers back on Earth itself, but…" he shook his head and
            looked away in apparent sadness, or at least further disappointment.</p>

        <p class="lead">"Wait,
            you’ve been back to Earth? What did you find??" What had happened to
            Earth, why it had gone dark halfway through their journey to Haven was the
            greatest mystery of all on her planet, the impetus of immeasurable amount of
            speculation, fear, and storytelling ever since.</p>

        <p class="lead">"Well…
            we found humans for sure, but certainly not much in the way of
            civilization. There had been no efforts made to preserve Earth history
            long term and without an active civilization around to curate information, all
            records disappeared as all digital storage media inevitably became corrupted.
            As such… there is only known to us one remaining repository of all of the
            history, art, and culture of Earth as it was in the entire universe"</p>

        <p class="lead">"New
            Horizon’s physical archives…" she marvelled. Of course. For her own
            people it was a primary prize on the ship but she could see how it could be
            even more so for Jaren’s people if they’d brought none of it along. All
            digital storage media on the surface had degraded beyond repair long before
            they’d learned how to recreate anything comparable, but they’d had it at one point,
            and a significant amount of it had been preserved through copied out physical
            texts or oral history and other forms of preservation. She could see
            though how empty a fog the past would seem without any of the information there
            to be preserved at all in the first place.</p>

        <p class="lead">"Exactly.
            The New Horizon’s physical archives. Your founders were very wise.
            They had the foresight not only to take with them all of the wisdom and
            knowledge of Earth, but to preserve it in so robust a way that it could survive
            unpowered and in a vacuum effectively for eternity. To us… those archives
            have taken on something of a mystical quality; like the… wisdom and knowledge
            of the ancients." His demeanor seemed to reveal his genuine
            reverence. She could almost swear she could detect the slightest
            mistiness in his eyes as he spoke of it.</p>

        <p class="lead">"You
            could have just taken it from us at any time though could you not? Or
            even probably copy it and leave again without us ever knowing. Why didn’t
            you?"</p>

        <p class="lead">"Because
            it’s yours," he said with a shrug. “That’s… just not our way. It
            would be disrespectful somehow of those who created it, not to mention your
            people, the legitimate heirs of it. It belongs to you; it’s your legacy,
            your endowment as a people, not ours. Now that you are ready though, now
            that you have taken this great technological leap, we are here to offer you a
            trade. </p>

        <p class="lead">"Go
            on…"</p>

        <p class="lead">"We
            want to make a copy of the entire archives, and in exchange for your permission
            to do so, we are prepared to offer you access to our Escher Rift system.
            You can use it to visit us, the Delta Pavonis colony, Earth… or any of the
            uninhabited systems our drones have been able to set up the local
            infrastructure, or will in the future.</p>

        <p class="lead">"That’s…
            quite an offer," Kathryn conceded while trying to keep her considerable
            excitement in check. As a person oriented towards excitement, adventure,
            and discovery, this was all quite literally a dream coming true.</p>

        <p class="lead">"We
            certainly hoped it would be enticing," Jaren said with a warm but knowing
            smile.</p>

        <p class="lead">Kathryn looked down and to her right while listening to
            distant voices debate how they should proceed. Finally a single voice
            clearly broke through the din. It was Krantz. “Tell him we accept
            in principle, and ask him how he suggests we proceed."</p>

        <p class="lead">"We are
            willing to accept your offer in," she reiterated. “Given that, how do you
            suggest that we proceed?"</p>

        <p class="lead">Jaren smiled even wider at the good news. “Well," he
            answered, “it would be too onerous for us to bring all of the equipment we
            would need all the way here. We would like to refurbish the New Horizon
            for you as a gesture of our good will. We would fuel and restart all of
            the power systems, update and restart the fusion core, magnetic shield, ion
            engines… we’d get the habitat ring spinning again to get you some gravity, and
            even rebuild the arboretum and the rest of your life support system, the
            works."</p>

        <p class="lead">This was beyond her imagining. Hew own people had
            technologically slid backwards quite considerably after their arrival on Haven,
            and were only now rediscovering basic rocketry. They’d hoped to learn
            much from studying the engineering of New Horizon and pouring through its
            archives, but the idea of refurbishing the ship and setting sail in it again
            was dreamt of only by the maddest among them. It was more an artefact to
            them than a vessel, a dead tomb as opposed to a sleeping marvel. </p>

        <p class="lead">"You
            could help us and learn along the way," he added, “and when we’re all done you
            can re-commission the ship and use it however you wish. It would be your
            gateway to the rift system until you develop another vehicle, and you could
            explore your own system and others through the rift system. But first,
            while you enjoy all the lavish trappings of an official diplomatic visit with
            us, we would get to work very carefully and methodically copying all of the
            information stored in the archives."</p>

        <p class="lead">"Where
            are you in our system at this point?" Kathryn asked him as casually as
            possible, still trying to keep her nearly bursting excitement contained until
            the end of the conversation.</p>

        <p class="lead">"We are
            still quite near to your star. Eschers can only be initiated very near to
            one. We have rather effective engines, but it will still take us
            approximately six of your days to arrive at your planet."</p>

        <p class="lead">"We
            call it Haven," Kathryn remarked with a larger note of pride than she’d
            expected from herself at relaying her home’s name to him.</p>

        <p class="lead">"Of
            course," he conceded with a deferential smile, “and tell your people not to
            worry. We are a small ship on a diplomatic mission, and there are only
            four of us. Though advanced, our vessel has limited armaments and one of
            your nuclear tipped missile could easily destroy us. We are not a threat
            to any of your people."</p>

        <p class="lead">"I
            understand, and I will relay your message. How do we proceed?"</p>

        <p class="lead">"As I
            said, it will take us six days to reach you. Our ship has the capacity to
            freely land and return to orbit, so we can meet you on the surface if your
            people don’t have the capacity or desire to send anyone up to us. In the
            meantime, as soon as a hard agreement has been reached, I can send a message
            back through another Escher to that effect, and have teams coming through to
            work on the New Horizon very soon after. When it’s ready, your people can
            assemble a team to board the ship and be escorted through the Escher to our
            star system."</p>

        <p class="lead">"Thank
            you Jaren, I will relay all of this to my authorities. We will be in
            touch."</p>

        <p class="lead">"It was
            very nice to meet you Commander Barnes," he said with a smile in which she
            detected something more than mere friendliness, and which made her feel warm
            though she did her best to not let it show.</p>

        <p class="lead">"You as
            well, Jaren."</p>

        <p class="lead">She touched the panel to close the channel, and brought her
            gloved hands up to grab onto the bulkhead in front of her as she lowered her
            head and let out a long sigh.</p>

        <p class="lead">"Control?"
            she asked.</p>

        <p class="lead">"Yes
            Commander?"</p>

        <p class="lead">"We
            don’t have nuclear tipped missiles do we?"</p>

        <p class="lead">"That’s
            classified."</p>

        <p class="lead">Kathryn kept her eyes closed as she shook her head.
            ‘Idiots…’</p>
