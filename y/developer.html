        <h1 class="display-4">I do software!</h1>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p class="lead">I am currently a software development student in the Computer Systems Technology program at the
            British Columbia Institute of technology in Burnaby, BC.</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p class="lead">I'm so excited to be going into my final term! I've learned so much so quickly, things I take
            for granted now which were challenging concepts just over a year ago. There is still so much for me to learn
            but I am eager to!
            <br><br>
            I wasn't sure when I applied to the CST program. I knew I was into computers, built my own PC and such, and
            was always very curious about what went on under the hood. I had a compatible curiosity, but couldn't know
            ahead of time if I'd enjoy the work. Turns out I do!</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p class="lead">It was intimidating and frustrating being a total novice up against people who already knew
            so much in my first term, but by the end of the third term I genuinely felt like I was solidly catching up
            with my peers, not to mention all of those who didn't make it along the way. I am fortuanate enough to be
            going into my final term with no fails on my record and a solid B+ average. 12 hour days 6 days a week, it's
            taken a lot of hard work, luck, and help from friends along the way. Now I'm looking forward to my next
            challenges.</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p class="lead">Along with my classew and project work this term, I will also be needing to look for work
            after I graduate in December. I'm not sure what area of the industry I'd like to work in; I'm pretty
            sure I don't want to work in gaming though. Areas that do interest me include Windows/.NET development,
            robotics, andspace stuff. I've looked it up and there are a dozen or so smaller robotics companies in town;
            it's a small sector waiting for a whale to land here according to an article I wrote.
            <br><br>
            MDA is a company I'm very interested in working for. They work with space robotics and
            telecommunications,which is SO COOL!! If I can't get in there right after graduation, it's a place I'd like
            to work my way towards. And of course all of my peers want to work at SAP. I'm very open to landing
            wherever, I just want to avoid being pigeon holed into a sector which will later be difficult to get out of.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">If you are a prospective employer checking me out, greetings! Feel free to look around! Although
            you've probably seen them already, please see below my cover letter and resume.</p>
